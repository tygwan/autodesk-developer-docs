# CheckPermission

Checks if a user has permission to perform specified actions on specified resources.

The user’s identity is derived from the _x-user-id_ header parameter (in a 2-Legged call), or from the Authorization Bearer token (in a 3-Legged call). The actions being checked for and the resources are specified in the JSON payload sent with the request. The resources can be folders, items, or even specified versions of an item.

The JSON response contains an array named `permissions`, where each element represents a resource that was checked. Each element of the array contains a `permission` attribute, which becomes `true` only if the user is permitted to perform all the specified actions for that resource. It becomes `false` even if one action is not permitted. To determine what action was not permitted, inspect the `details` object.

You can check up to 50 resources at a time.

The terms used to identify permitted actions by the CheckPermission command can be different from the terms used by the product you usually interact with. For example, the term _Admin_, which is used by the CheckPermissions command, is referred to as _Manage_ by Fusion 360.

The following table shows which BIM 360 actions you can check for and the equivalent CheckPermission terminology. Note that the command checks for all possible actions assigned to the user, including actions associated with the roles and companies assigned to the user.

| BIM 360 Action | CheckPermission Terms |
| --- | --- |
| view | view |
| download | download |
| upload | upload |
| collaborate | collaborate |
| edit | create, updateMetaData |
| full control | admin |

For information about which actions are assigned to different BIM 360 permission levels, see the [Help documentation](http://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=GUID-2643FEEF-B48A-45A1-B354-797DAD628C37).

The following table compares the terms used by BIM 360 Team, Fusion Team, and A360 Personal with the terms used by the CheckPermissions command.

| BIM360 Team, Fusion Team, A360 Personal Term |   | CheckPermission Term |
| --- | --- | --- |
| read
(Download and view specified resource) |   | read |
| download |   |   |
| view
(View specified resource without downloading) |   | view |
| collaborate
(Add comments to the specified resource) |   | collaborate |
| write
(Write and upload to the specified resource) |   | write |
| create |   |   |
| upload |   |   |
| updateMetaData |   |   |
| delete
(Delete the specified resource) |   | delete |
| manage
(Perform administrative operations on specified resource) |   | admin |
| share
(Share the specified resource) |   | share |

**Note:** CheckPermission is a Data Management command. Unlike typical CRUD operations, commands let you perform complex operations on multiple resources. For more details see [Commands](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/commands) .

## Resource Information

| Method and URI | POST https://developer.api.autodesk.com/data/v1/projects/:project_id/commands |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication Context | user context optional |
| Required OAuth Scopes | `data:read` |
| Data Format | JSON |

### Request

## Headers

| Authorization*string | Must be `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is obtained by means of a [two-legged](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-2-legged-token) or [three-legged](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token) OAuth flow. |
| --- | --- |
| x-user-idstring | In a two-legged authentication context, the app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. By providing this header, the API call is limited to act only on behalf of the specified user. |
| Content-Type*string | Must be `application/vnd.api+json`. |

### Request

## URI Parameters

| project_idstring | The unique identifier of a project.
For BIM 360 Docs, the project ID in the Data Management API corresponds to the project ID in the BIM 360 API. To convert a project ID in the BIM 360 API into a project ID in the Data Management API you need to add a “**b.**" prefix. For example, a project ID of c8b0c73d-3ae9 translates to a project ID of **b.**c8b0c73d-3ae9. |
