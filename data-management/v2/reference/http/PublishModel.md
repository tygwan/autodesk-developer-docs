# PublishModel

Publishes the latest version of a Collaboration for Revit (C4R) model to BIM 360 Docs. This enables other people to view, search, and socially interact with the model. Note that only the 3D default view and sheets are published.

To publish the latest model, you need to first:
- [Initiate collaboration through Revit](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/collaboration-for-revit), and select BIM 360 Docs. This creates the first version in BIM 360 Docs.
- Modify the model locally, and [synchronize the changes with the central model](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/collaboration-for-revit/learn-explore/caas/video/youtube/watch-v-RMlxaygDaU8.html).

You can verify whether a model needs to be published with the [GetPublishModelJob](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/GetPublishModelJob) command.

Note that this command is asynchronous and initiates a job that runs in the background, rather than halting execution of your program. When the model has finished publishing to BIM 360 Docs, a new version of the model is created. You can track the job’s progress by using the [GET projects/:project_id/items/:item_id](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET) endpoint, or the [Webhooks](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1/overview) API.

For more details about the workflow for using the PublishModel command, see the [Publish a C4R Model to BIM 360 Docs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/tutorials/publish-model/) tutorial.

Note that you do not need to create an empty storage object when uploading models using the PublishModel command. If you publish a C4R model using the PublishModel command, you cannot add new versions to the model using [POST versions](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-POST).

Note that PublishModel is a Data Management command. Commands enable you to perform complex operations on multiple resources
rather than standard CRUD operations. For more details about commands, see the
[Commands](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/commands) overview section.

## Resource Information

| Method and URI | POST https://developer.api.autodesk.com/data/v1/projects/:project_id/commands |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication Context | user context required |
| Required OAuth Scopes | `data:create` `data:write` |
| Data Format | JSON |

### Request

## Headers

| Authorization*string | Must be `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is obtained via either a [two-legged](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-2-legged-token) or [three-legged](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token) OAuth flow. Note that it will not accept a two-legged token, unless you add the `x-user-id` header. |
| --- | --- |
| x-user-idstring | In a two-legged authentication context, the app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. By providing this header, the API call will be limited to act on behalf of only the user specified. |
| Content-Type*string | Must be `application/vnd.api+json`. |

Note that for a three-legged OAuth flow or for a two-legged OAuth flow with user impersonation (`x-user-id`), the user must have at least edit permission for the BIM 360 Docs folder you publish the model to.

### Request

## URI Parameters

| project_idstring | The unique identifier of a project.
For BIM 360 Docs, the project ID in the Data Management API corresponds to the project ID in the BIM 360 API. To convert a project ID in the BIM 360 API into a project ID in the Data Management API you need to add a “**b.**" prefix. For example, a project ID of c8b0c73d-3ae9 translates to a project ID of **b.**c8b0c73d-3ae9. |
