# projects/:project_id/items

Creates the first version of a file (item). To create additional versions of an item, use [POST versions](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-POST).

Before you create the first version you need to [create a storage location](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-storage-POST) for the file, and [upload the file to the storage object](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-PUT). For more details about the workflow, see the tutorial on [uploading a file](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/tutorials/upload-file).

This endpoint also copies versions of items to other folders in the same project. The endpoint creates a new item and a first version of the item in the target folder. You cannot copy versions of items across different projects and accounts.

To copy versions of items to existng items in other folders, use [POST versions](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-versions-POST). POST versions creates a new version of the existing item in the target folder.

Note that to access BIM 360 Docs files using the Data Management API you need to provision your app in the BIM 360 Account Administrator portal. For more details, see the [Manage Access to Docs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/manage-access-to-docs) tutorial.

## Resource Information

| Method and URI | POST https://developer.api.autodesk.com/data/v1/projects/:project_id/items |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication Context | User context optional |
| Required OAuth Scopes | `data:create` |
| Data Format | JSON |

### Request

## Headers

| Authorization*string | Must be `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is a two-legged access token obtained via a [Client Credentials Grant flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-2-legged-token/), or a three-legged access token obtained via an [Authorization Code flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) or a [Secure Service Account (SSA) flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/ssa/v1/tutorials/getting-started-with-ssa/task3-generate-3-legged-access-token/).
The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type*string | Must be `application/vnd.api+json` |
| x-user-idstring | In a two-legged authentication context, the app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. By providing this header, the API call will be limited to act on behalf of only the user specified.
Note that for a three-legged OAuth flow or for a two-legged OAuth flow with user impersonation (`x-user-id`), the user must have permission to upload files to the specified parent folder (`data.attributes.relationships.parent.data.id`).
For copying files, the user must have permission to view the source folder.
For information about managing and verifying folder permissions for BIM 360 Docs, see the section on [Managing Folder Permissions](http://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=GUID-2643FEEF-B48A-45A1-B354-797DAD628C37). |

### Request

## URI Parameters

| project_idstring | The unique identifier of a project.
To convert BIM 360 or Forma Project IDs to Data Management Project IDs, prefix them with `b.` For example, a Project ID of `c8b0c73d-3ae9` becomes `b.c8b0c73d-3ae9`. |
| --- | --- |

### Request

## Query String Parameters

| copyFromstring | Only relevant for copying files to BIM 360 Docs - the version ID (URN) of the file to copy.
For details about finding the URN, follow the initial steps in the [Download a File](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/tutorials/download-file/) tutorial.
You can only copy files to the Plans folder or to subfolders of the Plans folder with an `item:autodesk.bim360:Document` item extension type, and you can only copy files to the Project Files folder or to subfolders of the Project Files folder with an `item:autodesk.bim360:File` item extension type.
To verify an item’s extension type, use [GET item](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET), and check the `attributes.extension.type` attribute.
Note that if you copy a file to the Plans folder or to a subfolder of the Plans folder, the copied file inherits the permissions of the source file. For example, if the end user did not have permission to download files in the source folder, but does have permission to download files in the target folder, he/she will not be able to download the copied file.
Note that you cannot copy a file if it is in the middle of being uploaded, updated, or copied. To verify the current process state of a file, call [GET item](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-GET), and check the `attributes.extension.data.processState` attribute. |

`CONFORMING`: The version conforms to its parent folder’s file naming standard.
`NON_CONFORMING`: The version does not conform to its parent folder’s file naming standard.

In the event of a `NON_CONFORMING` status, call [GET folders/folder_id](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-GET) to get the file naming standards IDs that have been applied to the version’s parent folder, and then use the ID to call [GET naming-standards](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/document-management-naming-standards-id-GET/) to get the details of the file naming standard.
Note that this feature is only available for BIM 360 projects.
To learn more about the file naming standard feature, see the [BIM 360 File Naming Standard](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=Common_Data_Environment) help documentation. |
