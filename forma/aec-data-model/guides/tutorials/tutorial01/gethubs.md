# Get Hubs

In this guide, you will learn how to retrieve a list of all the hubs you have access to.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
- Send a query using AEC Data Model Explorer.
- Understand the fields in the [hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/queries/hubs) query, [Hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/objects/hubs) object, and [Hub](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/objects/hub) objects.

You will use the following query in this guide:

| Type | Operation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Query | [hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/queries/hubs) | Retrieves all hubs accessible to you. |

## Step 1: Request a list of Hubs

The [hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/queries/hubs) query returns a [Hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/objects/hubs) object. The Hubs object contains an array of [Hub](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/reference/objects/hub) objects. While the Hub object has many fields, for this exercise, we will be requesting the `id` and the `name` fields only.
- In [AEC Data Model Explorer](https://aecdatamodel-explorer.autodesk.io/), the query is populated by default in the **Query Pane**. You can also edit or update the query as per your requirement and run it.  **Query**  

```
query GetHubs {
  hubs {
    pagination {
      cursor
    }
    results {
      name
      id
    }
  }
}
```

- Click **Play**. A list of hubs that you have access to is displayed in the response section. It should be similar to the following code-block:  **Response** 

```
{
  "data": {
    "hubs": {
      "pagination": {
        "cursor": null
      },
      "results": [
        {
          "name": "AEC DM Developer Advocacy Support",
          "id": "urn:adsk.ace:prod.scope:dccde3e3-c20c-40d3-a27c-7ac53b051b6e"
        },
        {
          "name": "Developer Advocacy Support",
          "id": "urn:adsk.ace:prod.scope:c0c44a35-fc67-4a8d-8967-f2d975bc03ec"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note down the ID of the hubs that you wish to use. You will need this ID for the remaining guides.

After working through the steps mentioned above, you should see a screen similar to the following image:
