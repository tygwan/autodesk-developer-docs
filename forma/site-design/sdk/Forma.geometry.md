# Forma.geometry

```ts
import { Forma } from "forma-embedded-view-sdk/auto";
```

## `getPathsByCategory`

```ts
Forma.geometry.getPathsByCategory(request: { /** Category to search for, such as "buildings" or "site_limit". */ category: string; /** Root URN of the proposal to obtain paths for. If not provided, the current proposal is used. */ urn?: string; }): Promise<string[]>;
```

Fetch paths of all elements in a proposal tagged with a specific category.
Traverses the element tree to also find any nested children tagged as well.

@returns
List of paths to elements tagged with the given category.

@example
// Fetch all paths to buildings in the current proposal.
const buildingPaths = await Forma.geometry.getPathsByCategory({ category: "buildings" })

## `getPathsForVirtualElements`

```ts
Forma.geometry.getPathsForVirtualElements(request?: { /** Root URN of the proposal to obtain paths for. If not provided, the current proposal is used. */ urn?: string; }): Promise<string[]>;
```

Fetch the paths of all elements in a proposal with the property 'virtual' set to true.
Traverses the element tree to also find any nested children tagged as well.

The virtual property can be used to describe something that isn't real,
like a constraint or an illustrative boy with balloon. If this is set,
analyses and possibly other modes will ignore the element.

@returns
List of paths to elements tagged as virtual.

@example
// Fetch paths to all elements in the current proposal that are virtual.
const virtualElementPaths = await Forma.geometry.getPathsForVirtualElements()

## `getFootprint`

```ts
Forma.geometry.getFootprint(request: { /** Path of the element to obtain footprint for, relative to root. */ path: string; /** Root URN of the proposal to obtain paths for. If not provided, the current proposal is used. */ urn?: string; }): Promise<Footprint | undefined>;
```

Fetch footprint representation of an element. Does not traverse children of
the element, so if any of them have footprint representations which
are of interest they need to be fetched separately using their complete path.

@returns
Footprint representation of the element pointed to by the given path.

@example
// Fetch footprint of the first found proposal site limit.
const siteLimitPaths = await Forma.geometry.getPathsByCategory({ category: "site_limit" })
const siteLimitFootprint = await Forma.geometry.getFootprint({ path: siteLimitPaths[0] })

## `getTriangles`

```ts
Forma.geometry.getTriangles(request?: { /** * Path of the element to recursively obtain mesh for. * * The path is relative to the root URN. * * @defaultValue "root" * * @example "root/a" * */ path?: string; /** * Paths to elements that are recursively excluded from the resulting mesh. * * The paths are relative to the root URN. * * @defaultValue Empty list, i.e. no excluded paths. * * @example "root/a/b" * */ excludedPaths?: string[]; /** Root URN of the proposal to obtain paths for. If not provided, the current proposal is used. */ urn?: string; }): Promise<Float32Array>;
```

Fetch mesh representation of an element and its children. Traverses the
element tree to also find any nested children with the `volumeMesh` representation.
All found meshes are concatenated into a flat list of triangles.

@returns
Mesh representation (list of triangles with vertex coordinates represented
as `Float32`s) of the element pointed to by the given path and its children.

@example
// Fetch mesh representation for the entire proposal and count the number of triangles.
const mesh = await Forma.geometry.getTriangles()
const numberOfVertices = mesh.length / 3
const numberOfTriangles = numberOfVertices / 3

@example
// Fetch mesh representation for one of the elements with category building and its children.
const buildingPaths = await Forma.geometry.getPathsByCategory({category: "building"})
if (buildingPaths.length > 0 ) {
   const mesh = await Forma.geometry.getTriangles({path: buildingPaths[0]})
}

@example
// Fetch mesh representation for the entire proposal except elements with category vegetation and their children.
const vegetationPaths = await Forma.geometry.getPathsByCategory({category: "vegetation"})
const mesh = await Forma.geometry.getTriangles({excludedPaths: vegetationPaths})

## `getPathsInsidePolygons`

```ts
Forma.geometry.getPathsInsidePolygons(request: { /** * The list of polygons that you want to check for overlap between */ polygons: [number, number][][]; }): Promise<string[]>;
```

Get all paths where the element's geometry has at least one vertex or point
inside at least one of the provided polygons.

Useful in cases where you need all buildings inside a site limit,
without needing to do all the calculations yourself.

For elements under the proposal, if an element is inside the polygon,
it is assumed that all its children are also inside the polygon.
Additionally, if a child is inside an element, it is assumed that
the parent is inside as well.

@example
const polygon = someSiteLimitPolygon
const pathsInside = await Forma.analysis.selection.getPathsInsidePolygons({
 polygons: [someSiteLimitPolygon]
})
