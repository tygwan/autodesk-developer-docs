# Forma.sun

```ts
import { Forma } from "forma-embedded-view-sdk/auto";
```

## `getDate`

```ts
Forma.sun.getDate(): Promise<Date>;
```

Fetch the `Date` corresponding to the current position of the sun in the scene.

@remarks
Since `Date` objects in JavaScript are based on the instance where the script is run,
it is important to capture the discrepancy between the machine local time and the time
at the project location. We recommend using a library such as
[Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) to handle this
-- their website has a lot of good documentation on the intricacies of time zones.

@returns Date for the current sun position.

@example
import { DateTime } from "luxon";

const projectTimezone = await Forma.project.getTimezone();
const projectDate = await Forma.sun.getDate()
const currentDate = DateTime.fromJSDate(currentDate, { zone: projectTimezone });

## `setDate`

```ts
Forma.sun.setDate(request: { /** Date corresponding to the wanted sun position. */ date: Date; }): Promise<void>;
```

Set the position of the sun in the scene.
