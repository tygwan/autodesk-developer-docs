Similarly, if you specify a specific PDF file it retrieves all the pushpin issues associated with all the PDF file pages. We do not currently support retrieving pushpin issues associated with a specific 2D sheet or view. By default, it returns pushpins for the latest version of the file. To retrieve pushpins for a specific version of a file together with pushpins for all previous versions of the specified file version, specify the version number, in the following format: @[version-number]. For example, filter[linkedDocument]=urn%3Aadsk.wipprod%3Adm.lineage%3AtFbo9zuDTW-nPh45gnM4gA@2. Separate multiple values with commas.
