## 요청

### URI 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the project. This corresponds to project ID in the Data Management API. To convert a project ID in the Data Management API into a project ID in the Forma API you need to remove the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7. |

### 쿼리 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fields` | array: string |  | A comma-separated list of the project fields to include in the response. Default value: all fields. Possible values: accountId, addressLine1, addressLine2, businessUnitId, city, companyCount, constructionType, country, createdAt, deliveryMethod, endDate, imageUrl, jobNumber, lastSignIn, latitude, longitude, memberCount, name, platform, postalCode, products, projectValue, sheetCount, startDate, stateOrProvince, status, thumbnailImageUrl, timezone, type and updatedAt. |

### 헤더

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a two-legged access token obtained via a Client Credentials Grant flow, or a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| `Region` | string |  | Specifies the region where your request should be routed. If not set, the request is routed automatically, which may result in a slight increase in latency. Possible values: US, EMEA. For a complete list of supported regions, see the Regions page. |
| `User-Id` | string |  | The ID of a user on whose behalf your request is acting. Your app has access to all users specified by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. Provide this header value to identify the user to be affected by the request. You can use either the user’s Forma ID (id), or their Autodesk ID (autodeskId). Note that this header is required for hub Admin POST, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints if you want to use a 2-legged authentication context. This header is optional for hub Admin GET endpoints. |
