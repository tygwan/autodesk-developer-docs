| `projectId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the project. Use the Data Management API to retrieve the project ID. For more information, see the Retrieve a Project ID tutorial. You can use a project ID either with a “b.” prefix or without a “b.” prefix. For instance, a project ID of “b.a4be0c34a-4ab7” can also be referred to as “a4be0c34a-4ab7”. |

### 쿼리 파라미터

| `currentOnly` | boolean |  | - true to only return versions of the sheets with the newest issuance date (this includes future issuance dates). This is only relevant if you uploaded multiple versions of the same sheet that were assigned the same number identifier. If you do not assign a value to the version set ID filter (filter[versionSetId]) this defaults to true. - false to return all sheets in the project. If you specify a value for the version set ID filter (filter[versionSetId]) this defaults to false. If you do not specify a version set, the default is true. |
| `filter[versionSetId]` | string |  | Filter sheets by the version set ID. If you assign a value to this filter, currentOnly defaults to false. If you do not assign a value, currentOnly default to true. |
| `filter[tags]` | string |  | Filter sheets by tags. You can filter by multiple tags. For example, filter[tags]=architecture&filter[tags]=structure returns sheets that include both architecture and structure tags. Use filter[tags]=__UNTAGGED to only return sheets without any tags. |
| `fields` | string |  | Specify which attributes you want to appear in the response. You can specify multiple attributes. For example, to only return the sheet ID and sheet number in the response, use fields=id&fields=number. |
| `searchText` | string |  | Search for sheets with the specified text. The API only searches in the number and title attributes. You can specify a string or part of a string. The search is case sensitive. You can only use one search string per call. For example, searchText=kitchen. |
| `withAllTags` | boolean |  | - true to return sheets that contain all search tags. - false to return sheets that contain at least one tag. If filter[tags]=__UNTAGGED is already in query parameters, withAllTags does not work. |
| `isDeleted` | boolean |  | - true to only return deleted sheets. - false to only return non-deleted sheets. The default value is false. You cannot retrieve both deleted and non-deleted sheets in one call. |
| `offset` | int |  | The starting point for the results, specified by item number. The default value is 0. For example, use offset=3 to start the results from the third item. |
| `limit` | int |  | The number of results to return in the response. Acceptable values: 1-100. Default value: 100. |
| `collectionId` | string |  | Filter by sheet collection. If not provided, only results in the ungrouped collection are returned. Possible values: - The UUID of an existing collection: Returns only the results within that collection. - * Returns results from all collections. |

### 헤더

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a two-legged access token obtained via a Client Credentials Grant flow, or a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| `x-user-id` | string |  | The ID of the user on whose behalf the API request is made. This header is optional when using a 2-legged OAuth2, but required if using 2-legged OAuth2 with user impersonation. When using 2-legged OAuth2 without user impersonation, your app has access to all users defined by the administrator in the SaaS integrations UI. However, when user impersonation is enabled, the API call is restricted to act only on behalf of the specified user. This header is not relevant for 3-legged OAuth2. You can use either the user’s Forma ID (id), or their Autodesk ID (autodeskId). |
