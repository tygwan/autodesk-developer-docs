## 요청

### URI 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | string |  | The ID of the project. Use the Data Management API to retrieve the project ID. For more information, see the Retrieve a Project ID tutorial. You need to convert the project ID into a project ID for the Forma API by removing the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7. |
| `templateId` | string |  | The unique identifier of the form template. Use GET form-templates to retrieve the template ID. |

### 헤더

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| `Content-Type` | string | **필수** | Must be application/json |
