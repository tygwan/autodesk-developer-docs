## 요청

### URI 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accountId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the hub. To obtain the hub ID, call GET hubs in the Data Management API and remove the “b.” prefix. |

### 쿼리 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sort` | string |  | The sort order of returned data connector objects. Possible values: asc ascending by date (earliest to latest date), desc descending by date (latest to earliest date). |
| `limit` | int |  | The number of data connector objects to return. Default value: 20 |
| `offset` | int |  | The number of data objects to skip before starting to starting to collect the result set. Default value: 0 |
| `sortFields` | string |  | A string of comma-separated names of the fields by which to sort the returned data requests. The results are sorted by the first field, then by the second field, and so on. Requests are sorted by each field in ascending order by default; you can prepend any field name with a hyphen ( - ) to sort in descending order. Invalid fields and whitespaces are ignored. Possible values: isActive, accountId, createdBy, createdByEmail, createdAt, updatedBy, updatedAt, scheduleInterval, reoccuringInterval, effectiveFrom, effectiveTo, startDate, endDate. |
| `filter[field_to_filter]` | string |  | Return only the data requests in which the specified field has the specified value. Use the following format in the endpoint URL: filter[field_to_filter]=_filter_value_. Note that you can provide multiple request filters in the URL, but you may not filter on multiple values of the same field. Possible field_to_filter values: projectId, createdAt, updatedAt, scheduleInterval, reocurringInterval, effectiveFrom, effectiveTo, isActive, startDate, endDate. You can also retrieve all data requests in the current hub by specifying filter[projectId]=null. For the createdAt and updatedAt fields (which accept a date range), specify the range in the form firstdate..lastdate, in ISO 8601 format with the time required. You can alternatively omit the first date (for example, to get everything on or before June 1, 2019 the range would be ..2019-06-01T23:59:59.999Z). You can also omit the last date (for example, to get everything after June 1, 2019 the range would be 2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z..) Additional notes on using startDate and endDate: - If you provide only startDate or endDate (but not both), Data Connector uses that single date for both startDate and endDate. - If you request more than the Maximum Date Range Allowed for an extraction, the default date range as documented in the schema documentation is returned. - For the activities service group, data replication can be delayed up to 20 minutes, so your requests should account for that delay. |

| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |

  - `createdBy` — `string`  
      The BIM 360 / Forma user ID of the user who created the data request.
  - `createdByEmail` — `string`  
      The email address of the user who created the data request.

      The date and time the data request was last updated, presented in ISO 8601 format.
  - `scheduleInterval` — `string`  
      The scheduling interval unit for jobs spawned by this data request. This value is multiplied by the reoccurringInterval attribute to specify the length of the recurring interval at which jobs run. Possible values: - ONE_TIME: Run the job only once - DAY: Set the recurring job interval in days - WEEK: Set the recurring job interval in weeks - MONTH: Set the recurring job interval in months - YEAR: Set the recurring job interval in years
  - `reoccuringInterval` — `int`

Note that the admin service includes both project and hub admin, and all indicates that the response contains data from all currently available service groups.
  - `callbackUrl` — `string`

The detailed schema documentation delivered with each data extract identifies the schemas and tables that support date range extraction. Additional notes on using startDate and endDate: - If you provide only startDate or endDate (but not both), Data Connector uses that single date for both startDate and endDate. - If you request more than the Maximum Date Range Allowed for an extraction, the default date range as documented in the schema documentation is returned. - For the activities service group, data replication can be delayed up to 20 minutes, so your requests should account for that delay.
  - `endDate` — `string`  
      The end date and time for the data extraction, in ISO 8601 format. This field applies only to schemas supporting date range extraction. The detailed schema documentation delivered with each data extract identifies the schemas and tables that support date range extraction. Additional notes on using startDate and endDate: - If you provide only startDate or endDate (but not both), Data Connector uses that single date for both startDate and endDate. - If you request more than the Maximum Date Range Allowed for an extraction, the default date range as documented in the schema documentation is returned. - For the activities service group, data replication can be delayed up to 20 minutes, so your requests should account for that delay.
  - `dateRange` — `string`  
      The timeframe used for extracting data in the request. Currently, it is applicable only to the Activities service and delta extraction service groups. This field contains the value specified in the request, indicating the range of data included in the response. Possible values: - TODAY: Data for the current day (from 00:00 UTC to the time the request was made). - YESTERDAY: Data for the previous calendar day (from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC). - PAST_7_DAYS: Data for the last 7 days, including the current day. - MONTH_TO_DATE: Data from the start of the current calendar month (00:00 UTC on the 1st) to the time the request was made. - LAST_MONTH: Data for the entire previous calendar month (00:00 UTC on the 1st to 23:59 UTC on the last day). - CUSTOM: Data for the date range defined by the startDate and endDate fields. Both fields are required when using this value.
