## 요청

### URI 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accountId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the hub. To obtain the hub ID, call GET hubs in the Data Management API and remove the “b.” prefix. |

### 헤더

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| `Content-Type` | string | **필수** | Must be application/json |

### 요청 본문

- `description` — `string`  
    The user-entered description of this data request.
- `isActive` — `boolean`  
    The data request’s active/inactive status. Possible values: true the request is active; false the request is inactive. If not supplied, the default value is true.
- `scheduleInterval` — `string`  
    The scheduling interval unit for jobs spawned by this data request. This value is multiplied by the reoccurringInterval attribute to specify the length of the recurring interval at which jobs run. Possible values: - ONE_TIME: Run the job only once - DAY: Set the recurring job interval in days - WEEK: Set the recurring job interval in weeks - MONTH: Set the recurring job interval in months - YEAR: Set the recurring job interval in years Note that recurring jobs start at the day and time when the request first spawns a job. This may be at the date and time specified in the attribute effectiveFrom.
- `reoccuringInterval` — `int`  
    The number of scheduleInterval units to wait between job execution for the request. For example, a scheduleInterval value of WEEK and a reoccuringInterval value of 2 means the job will run every two weeks. This value is required and must be a non-zero integer for all values of scheduleInterval except for a scheduleInterval value of ONE_TIME, in which case this value is ignored.
- `effectiveFrom` — `datetime: ISO 8601`  
    The date and time when a one-time job execution or a recurring interval schedule begins, presented in ISO 8601 format. If the date and time is before the current time, execution of scheduling begins immediately. This value is required.
- `effectiveTo` — `datetime: ISO 8601`  
    The date and time when the recurring interval schedule ends, presented in ISO 8601 format. This value must not be supplied for scheduleInterval values of ONE_TIME, but is required for all other scheduleInterval values.
- `serviceGroups` — `array: string`  
    The service groups from which to extract data, separated by commas. This required value must identify at least one service group. There are two types: standard service groups extract full datasets, and delta extraction service groups (identified by the cdc prefix, short for Change Data Capture) extract only records that have changed within the specified date range, and are available for selected service groups only. Standard service groups: all, activities, admin, assets, checklists, cost, dailylogs, forms, iq, issues, locations, markups, meetingminutes, photos, relationships, reviews, rfis, schedule, sheets, submittals, submittalsacc, transmittals. Delta extraction service groups (beta): cdcadmin, cdccost, cdcissues, cdclocations, cdcrfis, cdcschedule, cdcsubmittalsacc, cdcsheets, cdcmeetingminutes, cdctransmittals. Note that the admin service includes both project and hub admin, and all extracts data from all currently available service groups.
- `callbackUrl` — `string`  
    The callback URL specified for the data request. If specified, the Data Connection service calls the URL each time a job executes for the request. The service sends a POST request that provides job execution information. The JSON payload in the POST request contains the following: { "accountId": "account_id", "requestId": "request_id", "jobId": "data_connector_job_id", "state": "complete", "success": true or false }. If not specified, the Data Connection service does not provide a callback.
- `sendEmail` — `boolean`  
    Send a notification email to the user upon job completion. Values: true or false (default is true)
- `projectId` — `string`  
    (Legacy): A single project ID for the data request. Superseded by projectIdList.
- `projectIdList` — `array: string`  
    A list of up to 50 project IDs for the data request, which can include a single project or multiple projects. If projectId is also included, projectIdList takes precedence. Required for users with project admin permissions. Optional for users with executive overview permissions, who by default receive data for all projects unless projectIdList is provided.
- `startDate` — `string`  
    The start date and time for the data extraction, in ISO 8601 format. This field applies only to schemas supporting date range extraction. The detailed schema documentation delivered with each data extract identifies the schemas and tables that support date range extraction. Additional notes on using startDate and endDate: - If you provide only startDate or endDate (but not both), Data Connector uses that single date for both startDate and endDate. - If you request more than the Maximum Date Range Allowed for an extraction, the default date range as documented in the schema documentation is returned. - For the activities service group, data replication can be delayed up to 20 minutes, so your requests should account for that delay.
- `endDate` — `string`  
    The end date and time for the data extraction, in ISO 8601 format. This field applies only to schemas supporting date range extraction. The detailed schema documentation delivered with each data extract identifies the schemas and tables that support date range extraction. Additional notes on using startDate and endDate: - If you provide only startDate or endDate (but not both), Data Connector uses that single date for both startDate and endDate. - If you request more than the Maximum Date Range Allowed for an extraction, the default date range as documented in the schema documentation is returned. - For the activities service group, data replication can be delayed up to 20 minutes, so your requests should account for that delay.
- `dateRange` — `string`  
    Specifies the timeframe for extracting data in a scheduled request (DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR). Currently, it is applicable only to the Activities service and delta extraction service groups. Possible values: - TODAY: The current calendar day, from 00:00 UTC to the time the request is made. - YESTERDAY: The entire previous calendar day (00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC). - PAST_7_DAYS: The last 7 days, including the current day. - MONTH_TO_DATE: From the start of the current calendar month (00:00 UTC on the 1st) to the time the request is made. - LAST_MONTH: The entire previous calendar month (00:00 UTC on the 1st to 23:59 UTC on the last day). - CUSTOM: Data for the date range defined by the startDate and endDate fields. Both fields are required when using this value.
- `projectStatus` — `string`  
    The types of projects to be included in a request. The possible values are: - all: - all projects (default) - archived: archived projects only - active: active project only
