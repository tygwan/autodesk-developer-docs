| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `itemId` | string |  | The ID of the submittal item. To find the item ID, call GET items. |
| `projectId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the project. Use the Data Management API to retrieve the project ID. For more information, see the Retrieve a Project ID tutorial. You need to convert the project ID into a project ID for the Forma API by removing the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7. |

| `limit` | int |  | The maximum number of results per page. Possible values: 1- 50. Default value: 20. For example, to limit the response to two results per page, use limit=2. |
| `offset` | int |  | The number of results to skip before starting to return data. For example, to skip the first 20 results, include offset=20 in the query string. For more details, see the JSON API Paging Help documentation. |
| `sort` | string |  | Sort attachments by specific fields in either ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order. Separate multiple criteria with commas. For example, statusId asc. Possible values: id, isFileUploaded, asyncState, createdBy, createdAt, updatedBy, updatedAt, name, uploadUrn, urn, urnPage, resourceUrns, urnTypeId, urnVersion, revision, categoryId, isReview, isResponse. |
| `filter[categoryId]` | string |  | Filter attachments by category identifier. Multiple values can be separated by commas. |
| `filter[revision]` | string |  | Filter items with the specified revision number. You can specify multiple values. Separate multiple values with commas. For example, filter[revision]=1. |

| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
