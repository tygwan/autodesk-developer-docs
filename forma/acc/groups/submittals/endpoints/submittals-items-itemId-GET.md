| `projectId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the project. Use the Data Management API to retrieve the project ID. For more information, see the Retrieve a Project ID tutorial. You need to convert the project ID into a project ID for the Forma API by removing the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7. |
| `itemId` | string |  | The ID of the submittal item. To find the item ID, call GET items. |

| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |

### 응답 본문 (200)

- `id` — `string: UUID`  
    The internal, globally unique identifier (UUID) for the submittal item.
- `identifier` — `int`  
    The unique ID assigned to the submittal item within the UI. This ID is system-generated and serves as a reference for users interacting with submittal items through the UI. For example, 111.
- `customIdentifier` — `string`  
    customIdentifier and customIdentifierHumanReadable relate to the Number column in the UI. Submittal managers assign custom numbers to items (manually or automatically). Custom numbers are configured either in global numbering format: <global number>, or in spec section numbering format: <spec ID>-<sequential number>. For projects with a global numbering format, both customIdentifier and customIdentifierHumanReadable represent the global number. For projects with a spec section numbering format (<spec ID>-<sequential number>), customIdentifier represents the sequential number. For example, for a full number of 033100-01, customIdentifier is 01. Note that for unnumbered items customIdentifier is null. For more information on custom numbering, see the Help documentation.
- `customIdentifierHumanReadable` — `string`  
    customIdentifierHumanReadable and customIdentifier relate to the Number column in the UI. Submittal managers assign custom numbers to items (manually or automatically). Custom numbers are configured either in global numbering format: <global number>, or in spec section numbering format: <spec ID>-<sequential number>. For projects with a global numbering format, both customIdentifier and customIdentifierHumanReadable represent the global number. For projects with a spec section numbering format (<spec ID>-<sequential number>), customIdentifierHumanReadable represents the full number - both the spec ID and the sequential number. For example, for a full number of 033100-01, customIdentifierHumanReadable is 033100-01. Note that for unnumbered items customIdentifierHumanReadable is Unspecified. For spec section numbering it also includes the spec ID. For example, 033100-Unspecified. For more information on custom numbering, see the Help documentation.
