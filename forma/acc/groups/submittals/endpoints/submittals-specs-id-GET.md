## 요청

### URI 파라미터

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | string: UUID |  | The ID of the project. Use the Data Management API to retrieve the project ID. For more information, see the Retrieve a Project ID tutorial. You need to convert the project ID into a project ID for the Forma API by removing the “b." prefix. For example, a project ID of b.a4be0c34a-4ab7 translates to a project ID of a4be0c34a-4ab7. |
| `id` | string |  | The ID of the submittal item to retrieve revisions for. To obtain this ID, call GET items. |

### 헤더

| 이름 | 타입 | 필수 | 설명 |

| `Authorization` | string | **필수** | Must be Bearer <token>, where <token> is a three-legged access token obtained via an Authorization Code flow or a Secure Service Account (SSA) flow. The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
