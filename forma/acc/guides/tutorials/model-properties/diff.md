# Tracking Changes in Model Versions

This step-by-step tutorial describes how to create and query a diff.

## Step 1: Specify the diff index

To create a basic diff index, call the [batch status method](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/index-v2-diff-jobs-batch-status-post/).

### Example Request

In the request below, a `POST` is made to the [diff batch status endpoint](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/index-v2-diff-jobs-batch-status-post/). Index resources will be created for each pair of files in the payload. There are no `query` or `columns` properties set in the payload, so no query results will be generated in response to this operation.

```
curl --request POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs:batch-status' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ****' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "diffs": [
             {
                 "prevVersionUrn": "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=1",
                 "curVersionUrn": "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=2"
             }
         ]
     }'
```

### Example Response

The response to the above request returns an array of index status objects, one per pair of files compared. In the example above we would only expect a single element to be returned in this array. The `diffId` on the status object is the unique identifier for the diff index and can be used in subsequent calls to track the progress of the indexing job(s) and to later download the resources associated with the index(s). Calling the batch status endpoint multiple times will not result in multiple, duplicate indexes as long as the input parameters of the request do not change. Provided the array of objects in the `diffs` set, `query` and optionally `columns` properties passed to the endpoints remain unchanged, the caller will always be returned the same `diffId`.

In addition to the `diffId`, the status response object contains the status of the indexing job. Once calculated, indexes are cached for 30 days on a rolling event horizon that is incremented every time the index is accessed. If an index is not accessed for 30 days it will fall out of the cache and will need to be subsequently recalculated. A status of `PROCESSING` indicates that the service is building the index. This could include waiting for SVF2 translation to complete. When the service has successfully created an index, the status will be set to `FINISHED`. This indicates that the index and all its resources are available for download. The contract returned by the index service in response to an index status request also includes a suggested `retryAt` timestamp, which can be used to regulate status polling frequency. The example response below is simplified to show an single status object. In reality, three would have been returned in response to the request above.

[
    {
        "projectId": "f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46",
        "diffId": "_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA",
        "type": "DIFF",
        "state": "PROCESSING",
        "selfUrl": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA",
        "prevVersionUrns": [
            "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=1"
        ],
        "curVersionUrns": [
            "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=2"
        ],
        "updatedAt": "2021-08-23T08:43:19.211855+00:00",
        "retryAt": "2021-08-27T16:33:53.8479932+00:00",
        "stats": null,
        "manifestUrl": null,
        "fieldsUrl": null,
        "propertiesUrl": null
    },
    ...
]
```

The properties returned by this endpoint are as follows:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `projectId` | The project GUID |
| `diffId` | The unique ID for the diff index |
| `type` | The type of index, INDEX (standard) or DIFF |
| `state` | The status of the indexing job (PROCESSING, FINISHED, FAILED) |
| `selfUrl` | The URL to this index job |
| `prevVersionUrns` \| The array of previous file version URNs passed to the indexing job |   |
| `curVersionUrns` \| The array of current file version URNs passed to the indexing job |   |
| `updatedAt` | The date time the status of this job was last refreshed |
| `retryAt` | The suggested date time at which callers should poll for an updated status |
| `stats` | If the index state is FINISHED, the statistics for this index in terms of the number of
objects added, removed, or changed |
| `manifestUrl` | If the index state is FINISHED, the URL to the manifest for this index, otherwise null |
| `fieldsUrl` | If the index state is FINISHED, the URL to the fields for this index, otherwise null |
| `propertiesUrl` | If the index state is FINISHED, the URL to the properties for this index, otherwise null |
| `queryResultsUrl` | If a query was passed in the index specification, the results of this query when state is FINISHED |

## Step 2: Poll for progress

To track the progress of an indexing request send a `GET` request to the [diff index status endpoint](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/index-v2-diff-status-get/) using the `diffId` obtained in the request. When the index has a status of `FINISHED` processing, the index is available for querying and downloading.

### Example Request

```
curl --request GET 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ****'
```

### Example Response

```
{
    "projectId": "f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46",
    "diffId": "_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA",
    "type": "DIFF",
    "state": "FINISHED",
    "selfUrl": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA",
    "prevVersionUrns": [
        "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=1"
    ],
    "curVersionUrns": [
        "urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.R2CfQt3AS6WL0Bmmnld3uQ?version=2"
    ],
    "updatedAt": "2021-08-23T08:43:19.211855+00:00",
    "retryAt": "2021-08-27T16:42:30.3967772+00:00",
    "stats": {
        "added": 64,
        "removed": 57,
        "modified": 284
    },
    "manifestUrl": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA/manifest",
    "fieldsUrl": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA/fields",
    "propertiesUrl": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA/properties"
}
```

When an index has been successfully created (`state` equals `FINISHED`), it contains three downloadable json.gz resources: a manifest describing the files and SVF2 database resources that were used to create the index, a list of fields (dimensions) in the index, and the index property data. Each of these resources has a URL that can be used to fetch the corresponding resource. The response JSON is identical to the response returned by the `POST` to the batch status endpoint (Step 1 above). If an optional query was passed during the index specification, the the results of this query will be available for download (Step 7).

## Step 3: (Optional) Download the manifest

To retrieve the diff index manifest, make a `GET` to the [manifest endpoint](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/index-v2-diff-manifest-get/), the format of which is described in the [field guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/model-properties).

The structure of the manifest resource returned by this endpoint is described in the [field guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/model-properties) page.

## Step 4: (Optional) Download the fields

In order to query a diff index, first [download the fields resource](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/index-v2-diff-fields-get/), which describes the columns available in the index. The index fields are obtained by a call to the `fieldsUrl` returned either by a call to the status endpoint (Step 1) or by polling the state of a running indexing job (Step 2). Skip this step if you already know the field keys you require for your query.

### Example Request

```
curl --request GET 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA/fields' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ****'
```

### Example Response

TRUNCATED
```

The structure of the fields resource returned by this endpoint is described in the [field guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/model-properties/overview/) page.

## Step 5: (Optional) Download the raw index

While the indexing service is designed to run SQL-like queries targeting the fields contained within the indexes it hosts, it is possible to download raw indexes created by the service in their entirety. The raw index properties are obtained by a call to the `propertiesUrl` returned either by a call to the status endpoint (Step 1) or by polling the state of a running indexing job (Step 2).

The structure of the properties resource returned by this endpoint is described in the [field guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/model-properties/overview/) page.

## Step 6: Build and run a query

Once an index has been successfully created it can be queried using the `queries` endpoint for the index via the `diffId` which can be obtained by a call to the status tracking endpoints (Steps 1 or 2 above). Index diff queries are described using a custom JSON schema which is converted to a filter expression and applied line by line to to the index. This documentation includes a [comprehensive query language reference](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/model-properties/query-ref) which describes how to form index and diff queries by example using this JSON schema.

### Example Request

The query schema targets the structure of the JSON index rows. In the example `POST` to the `queries` endpoint below, the `$ne` operator is used to return rows where value for index field `p1b2aabe1` is different between the current version of the object (`s.props.p1b2aabe1`) and the previous version of the object (`s.prev.props.p1b2aabe1`).

             ]
         }
     }'
```

### Example Response

The response from the `queries` endpoint is very similar to the response from the index status polling endpoints. The only additional property returned by this endpoint is a `queryId` value. This `queryId` is a unique identifier for the query execution and can be used to poll the progress of the query job. As with index operations a query is successful when its `state` is set to `FINISHED`. Index queries also have the standard `manifestUrl`, `fieldsUrl` and `propertiesUrl` values that point to the index resources used when performing the query. In addition the `queries` endpoint also returns a `queryResultsUrl` property that points to a gzip’d, line-delimited JSON resource that contains the filtered index rows matching the query filter expression when the query reaches the `FINISHED` state.

    "propertiesUrl": null,
    "queryResultsUrl": null
}
```

## Step 7: Poll for query progress

The diff index `queries` endpoint follows the same pattern as the status endpoint. The `queryId` obtained in the `POST` to the `queries` endpoint can be used to poll the progress of the query.

### Example Request

```
curl --request GET 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/index/v2/projects/f83cef12-deef-4771-9feb-4f85643e3c46/diffs/_ukKZbcA8TN9CLMgLchgnA/queries/gcUcnanaZbk3rPWnZ_cjmQ' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ****'
```

### Example Response

The response to this status `GET` is identical to the response returned by the `POST` to the `queries` endpoint. In the example below the query `state` is set to `FINISHED` and the `queryResultsUrl` is not null, indicating that the query has been completed successfully and the results are available for download.

}
```

## Step 8: Download query results

The final step in the process is to use the `queryResultsUrl` to download the index rows that match the submitted query expression. These line delimited JSON result rows are a subset of the property diff index rows and have exactly the same format.
