# Create Relationships

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a relationship between two entities (for example, an asset and a document). The steps include verifying compatibility of entity types in the Relationships service, finding information about the entities you want to create a relationship for, and creating the relationship between the entities. For information about the Relationships API, see the [Field Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview/field-guide/relationships/).

Note that in order to create a relationship between two entities, the entities must already exist, and the caller must have permission to
access both entities in the proposed relationship.

## Before You Begin
- [Register an app](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps), and select the Data Management and BIM 360 APIs.
- Acquire a [3-legged OAuth token](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) with `data:create` `data:read` and `data:write` scopes.
- Verify that you have access to the relevant hub, project, folder and contents.
- Find the relationships container ID for the relevant project.

Note that this tutorial assumes you are familiar with the BIM 360 Assets and Document Management APIs.

## Step 1: Verify Entity Compatibility

You first need to check whether the entities you want to associate with each other are compatible.

To verify compatibility, call [GET utility/relationships:writable](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/relationship-service-v2-get-writable-relationship-domains-GET), and find the object containing the relationship domain and entity type you want to create a relationship against.
For example, check whether you can create a relationship between an asset and a document. The asset `domain` is `autodesk-bim360-asset`, and the `entity type` is `asset`. In this example, the `allow` attribute contains an array of entity types that assets can have a relationship with. For a list of domains and their entity types, see the [Relationship Querying tutorial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/relationships/relationships-tutorial).

Note that some domains have a `bim360` prefix, and others have a `construction` prefix.

                           "form",
                           "formfield"
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
 }
]
```

## Step 2: Find Information About Entities

You need to find information about the entities you want to create a relationship for. For example, to create a relationship between an asset and a document, you need to call [GET assets](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/assets-assets-v2-GET/) to find the ID of the asset, and [GET folders/:folder_id/contents](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET/) to find the ID of the document.

## Step 3: Create a Relationship

To create relationships between compatible entities, use the information you found in the previous steps and the container ID to call [PUT containers/:containerId/relationships](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/relationship-service-v2-add-relationships-PUT).
Note that one entity may be related to a batch of up to 20 entities within a single API call.

In this example, we are creating a relationship between an asset and a document.

                    }
                ]
            }
        ]'
```

### Example Response

     "isReadOnly": false,
     "isService": false,
     "isDeleted": false,
     "entities": [
         {
             "domain": "autodesk-bim360-asset",
             "type": "asset",
             "id": "2b95ba7a-3df5-4e99-a693-9c7cc15ee8c0"
         },
         {

             "type": "documentlineage",

         }
     ]
 }
]
```

Note that you can create relationships by supplying your own relationship IDs (UUID). For example, you can choose to use `b544a7eb-3c64-4a56-a7ff-392d0441015f` as the ID. If the ID is already in use, the server will reject the request with an HTTP `409 Conflict` error.
