# Configure a Locations Tree

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure a hierarchy (a tree) of building areas (locations), also known as a _location breakdown structure_ (LBS). Each location is a node in the tree. The steps include retrieving the tree’s root node ID (representing the project); creating two second-tier nodes with the root as their parent; adding a third-tier node under one of the second-tier nodes; renaming a node; and deleting a node.

For more details about this API, see the [Locations API Field Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/locations/).

## Before you begin
- [Register an app](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps)
- Acquire a [3-legged OAuth token](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) with `data:read` and `data:write` scope.
- Verify that you have access to the relevant Forma hub and project.
- Use the Data Management API to [retrieve the relevant Forma hub and project IDs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/getting-started/retrieve-account-and-project-id/). This tutorial uses the example project ID `e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013`, but you should replace that with the project ID you have retrieved for your project.

In this tutorial, the LBS is used as follows:
- The top-tier (root) node represents a hotel.
- The second-tier nodes represent floors of the hotel.
- The third-tier nodes represent rooms on each floor.

Note that the nodes in a given tier don’t all have to represent the same type of location. For example, a second-tier node could represent the hotel’s roof.

## Step 1: Retrieve the root node ID

Use the [GET nodes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodes-GET/) endpoint to retrieve the root node of your project’s LBS. This tutorial uses `24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8` as an example of the root node ID of the tree.

Note that when the project is new, only the root node is returned, so no pagination is necessary.

### Request

```
curl --request GET 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT'
```

### Response

```
200 Succeeded

{
    {
        "results": [
            {
                "id": "24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8",
                "parentId": null,
                "type": "Root",
                "name": "Project",
                "description": null,
                "barcode": null,
                "order": 0
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The response payload includes the root node ID (`results.id`) value of `24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8`.

## Step 2: Create the first and second floor nodes

Use the [POST nodes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodes-POST/) endpoint to create the new nodes in the second tier of the LBS.

Note that the root node is automatically created with the project.

### Step 2.1: Create the second floor node

Create a new node and name it `Floor 2` (_not_ `Floor 1`). Assign `Floor 2`’s parent by specifying the root node’s ID as the value of `parentId`. In this way you start to define the tree hierarchy.

### Request

```
curl --request POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT' \
-d '{
        "parentId": "24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Floor 2",
        "barcode": "barcodeFloor2"
    }'
```

### Response

```
201 Created

{
    {
        "id": "15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1",
        "parentId": "24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Floor 2",
        "description": null,
        "barcode": "barcodeFloor2",
        "order": 0
    }
}
```

Now your LBS should look as follows:

```
       Project
       (Hotel)
      /
     /
Floor 2
```

The response payload includes the `Floor 2` ID (`id`) value of `15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1`.

### Step 2.2: Create the first floor node

Create a new node and name it `Floor 1`. Assign Floor 1’s parent by specifying the root node’s ID as the value of `parentId`.

Note that this request contains two query parameters: The `targetNodeId` value is the `id` of the Floor 2 node, and the `insertOption` value is `Before`, indicating that the Floor 1 node should come before the Floor 2 node in sequence order. For more details, see [POST nodes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodes-POST/) .

### Request

```
curl --request POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes?targetNodeId=15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1&insertOption=Before' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT' \
-d '{
        "parentId": "24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Floor 1",
        "barcode": "barcodeFloor1"
    }'
```

### Response

```

{
    {
        "id": "94eb2ce9-8b3f-45e8-a178-894c8c49725b",
        "parentId": "24d53a28-cda0-43b0-9021-863736edebf8",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Floor 1",
        "description": null,
        "barcode": "barcodeFloor1",
        "order": 0
    }
}
```

Now your LBS should look as follows:

```
      Project
      (Hotel)
     /       \
    /         \
Floor 1      Floor 2
```

The response payload includes the Floor 1 ID (`id`) value of `94eb2ce9-8b3f-45e8-a178-894c8c49725b`, and the `order` value of `0`, indicating that Floor 1 is before Floor 2 in sequence order (Floor 2’s `order` is now `1`).

## Step 3: Create a second floor suite node

Under the `Floor 2` node, use the [POST nodes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodes-POST/) endpoint to create a new node and name it `Suite 205`. Assign `Suite 205`’s parent by specifying the `Floor 2` ID as the value of `parentId`.

### Request

```
curl --request POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT' \
-d '{
        "parentId": "15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Suite 205",
        "barcode": "barcodeSuite205"
    }'
```

### Response

```
201 Created

{
    {
        "id": "76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807",
        "parentId": "15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1",
        "type": "Area",
        "name": "Suite 205",
        "description": null,
        "barcode": "barcodeSuite205",
        "order": 0
    }
}
```

Your LBS should look as follows:

```
      Project
      (Hotel)
     /       \
    /         \
Floor 1      Floor 2
                \
                 \
               Suite 205
```

The response payload includes the `Suite 205` ID (`id`) value of `76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807`.

## Step 4: Update the suite node

Use the [PATCH nodes/{nodeId}](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodesnodeid-PATCH/) endpoint to update the node’s `name`, `barcode`, or both.

Note that you cannot send the request without at least one of these two fields.

Update node `Suite 205`’s name to be “`Suite 211`”, and its barcode to be “`barcodeSuite211`” (passing the node’s ID as a URI parameter).

### Request

```
curl --request PATCH 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes/76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT' \
-d '{
        "name": "Suite 211",
        "barcode": "barcodeSuite211"
    }'
```

### Response

```
200 Ok

{
    {
        "name": "Suite 211",
        "description": null,
        "barcode": "barcodeSuite211",
        "parentId": "15e5bd3f-8334-4a98-9365-3489b83506f1",
        "id": "76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807",
        "type": "Area",
        "order": 0
    }
}
```

Your LBS should look as follows:

```
      Project
      (Hotel)
     /       \
    /         \
Floor 1      Floor 2
                \
                 \
               Suite 211
```

The response payload includes the node’s updated `name` and `barcode`.

## Step 5: Delete the suite node

Use the [DELETE nodes/{nodeId}](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/locations-nodesnodeid-DELETE/) endpoint to delete the `Suite 211` node by passing the node’s ID (`76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807`) as a URI parameter.

### Request

```
curl --request DELETE 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/locations/v2/projects/e4ae9874-0ab6-4b33-ac91-ff70e806e013/trees/default/nodes/76e6814b-4a10-4347-80bd-d9b429453807' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer nFRJxzCD8OOUr7hzBwbr06D76zAT'
```

### Response

```
204 No Content
```

Finally, your LBS should look as follows:

```
      Project
      (Hotel)
     /       \
    /         \
Floor 1      Floor 2
```

Congratulations! You have created a location breakdown structure and modified it using the Locations API.
