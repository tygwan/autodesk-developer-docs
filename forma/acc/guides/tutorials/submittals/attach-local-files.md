# Attach Local Files to Submittals

This tutorial demonstrates how to attach local files to a submittal item in a Forma project. The steps include verifying the user’s permissions and gathering required fields, creating the attachment object, generating a signed S3 URL, uploading the file to the signed URL, and updating the attachment status. For more information on working with submittals, see the [Help documentation](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Create_Submittal).

For information about attaching files to submittals that were already uploaded to the Forma Files tool, see the [Attach Files to Submittals from the Files Tool](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/attach-files-tool/) tutorial.

## Before You Begin
- [Register an app](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps)
- Acquire a [3-legged OAuth token](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) with `data:read` `data:write` scopes.
- Verify that you have access to the relevant hub and Forma project.
- Find the relevant project ID for the project you want to create a submittal item in by following the [Retrieve a Hub ID and Project ID](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/getting-started/retrieve-account-and-project-id/) tutorial. In this example, assume the project ID is `91b5ea71-e3ea-495b-999d-57443a8af6a4`.
- This tutorial assumes an item was created in Submit state `sbc-1` by a user with manager permissions. For more information on creating a submittal item, see the [Create a Submittal Item](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/submittals/create-submittal-item/) tutorial. In this example, assume the submittal item ID is `938eb16d-5603-4df9-adcd-00f75d48e145`.
- Ensure you have assigned manager-level permissions to at least one user for the project via the UI. To assign a manager to a submittal item, you need to ensure the user has the necessary permissions and roles set within the project. For instructions on setting up roles and permissions see the [Help documentation](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BUILD/ENU/?guid=Submittals_Permissions).
- The Submittal Item workflow progresses through several sequential states. Below are the states in the UI and their equivalent API names: UI StateAPI Name Submit `sbc-1`  Prepare for Review `mgr-1`  Review `rev`  Close and Distribute `mgr-2`  Closed `sbc-2`

## Step 1: Verify Permissions and Fields

Before uploading an attachment, verify the user’s permissions and gather the mandatory and optional fields required to make the [POST attachment](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-attachments-POST/) request in step 2.

Call [GET item/:id](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-items-itemId-GET/) using the project ID (`2570d4e5-9aef-4b41-8e45-a454f2f3fd65`) and the submittal item ID (`938eb16d-5603-4df9-adcd-00f75d48e145`). Check the `permittedActions` object for `Attachment::create`. If this action is listed, the user has permission to create an attachment.

The `permittedActions` object also provides the `mandatoryFields` and `fields` arrays, which specify the required and optional parameters for the POST attachments request. Calling [GET item/:id](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-items-itemId-GET) at any stage in the workflow will return the permitted actions for the user at that point for the submittal item.

                "steps"
            ],

        }
    ],
    "customIdentifier": "12",
    "customIdentifierHumanReadable": "12"
}
```

Note the following:
- Mandatory Fields:   Locate the `permittedActions` object with `"id": "Attachment::create"`. The `mandatoryFields` array specifies the required fields for creating an attachment:  `name`: The name of the attachment.
- `urnTypeId`: The type of object being referenced. This field must always be included, and its value should always be `2`.
- Optional Fields:   Under the same `"id": "Attachment::create"` entry, the `fields` array lists optional parameters:  `categoryId`: Links the attachment to a specific workflow state.

Include these fields in your POST attachment request in Step 2.

## Step 2: Create an Attachment Object

Call [POST attachment](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-attachments-POST/) to create the attachment object. This step registers the attachment metadata with the submittal item but does not yet upload the file.
- The `urnTypeId` field must be included in the request and should always have the value `2`.
- The `categoryId` is typically assigned automatically based on the submittal item’s current state. In most cases, you do not need to include `categoryId` in your request. However, for specific exceptions, you must provide it explicitly:   Prepare for Review (`mgr-1`): By default, when the submittal item is in the Prepare for Review state, the `categoryId` is assigned automatically as `2` (for-review). If you want the attachment to be tagged as a Submit state attachment instead, you must explicitly set `categoryId` to `1` in the request.
- Final Response Attachments: If you are closing a submittal item from a state other than Close and Distribute (`mgr-2`), and you want the attachment to be marked as a final response, explicitly set `categoryId` to `4`.
- For items in the Review (`rev`) state, include the `taskId` field to associate the attachment with a specific task. This ensures the attachment is linked to the relevant task in the review process.

You can retrieve the full list of available `categoryId` values and their corresponding meanings by calling [GET metadata](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-metadata-GET/), and reviewing the `attachmentCategories` list in the response.

```

Note the following:
- Attachment ID (`id`): This is required for subsequent steps to update the attachment or finalize its status.
- Category ID (`categoryId`): Ensure it is correctly set, either automatically or manually, depending on the workflow state.
- Permitted Actions: The object containing `"id": "Attachment::partial_update"` in the response indicates that the user can update the attachment with `isFileUploaded=true`. This will be used in Step 6.
- Upload URN (`uploadUrn`- `urn:adsk.objects:os.object:wip.dm.prod/a9d330bc-411f-4aaf-874a-9844cc002d00.pdf`): Use this in Step 3 to generate a signed S3 URL for uploading the file.

The upload URN includes the following sections: `<urn:adsk.objects:os.object>:<bucket key>/<object key>`
Note the bucket key - `wip.dm.prod` and the object key - `a9d330bc-411f-4aaf-874a-9844cc002d00.pdf`

## Step 3: Generate a Signed S3 URL

Use the bucket key from the uploadUrn (`wip.dm.prod`) and the object key (`a9d330bc-411f-4aaf-874a-9844cc002d00.pdf`) to call [GET signeds3upload](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-GET/) to generate a signed URL for the storage object.

This endpoint supports generating multiple signed URLs, which allows you to upload multiple chunks of the same file in parallel. For more information, see [GET signeds3upload](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-GET/).

  ]

}
```

Note the `uploadKey` and the `urls` response attributes.

## Step 4: Upload a File to the Signed URL

To upload the file to the signed URL, use a PUT method and the `urls` attribute as the URI.

Note that you should not use a bearer token with this call.

### Request

```
curl -X PUT --data-binary @D:\sbc1-file1.pdf "https://com-autodesk-oss-direct-upload.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/signed-url-uploads/26668812-6bb1-4f80-bab2-09776f24fd98?uploadId=[UPLOAD_ID]&partNumber=1&X-Amz-Security-Token=[AMZ_TOKEN]%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220203T052230Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-Credential=[AMZ_CREDENTIAL]%2F20220203%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=[AMZ_SIGNATURE]"
```

Note that a successful call (`200`) returns an empty response.

## Step 5: Complete the Upload

Use the bucket key (`wip.dm.prod`), the object key (`a9d330bc-411f-4aaf-874a-9844cc002d00.pdf`) and the upload key (`AQICAHgdUabBXKpMwUkoF5ivioCSHNq_j4g7HRbexUuX..........UbHJ5QNz9quo=`) to call [POST signeds3upload](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST/) to complete the upload.

This endpoint needs to be called within 24 hours from the time you began uploading the file.

### Request

```
curl -X POST "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets/wip.dm.prod/objects/a9d330bc-411f-4aaf-874a-9844cc002d00.pdf/signeds3upload" \

}
```

The file has been uploaded to the storage object.

## Step 6: Finalize the Attachment Status

Call [PATCH attachment](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/submittals-attachments-attachmentId-PATCH/) with `isFileUploaded=true` to update the attachment status. This step marks the attachment as fully uploaded and ensures it is recognized as complete in the submittal workflow.

Use the `id` of the attachment generated in Step 2 and update the status.

### Request

```
curl -X PATCH 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/construction/submittals/v2/projects/2570d4e5-9aef-4b41-8e45-a454f2f3fd65/items/938eb16d-5603-4df9-adcd-00f75d48e145/attachments/c14eabff-d79c-4429-9fa4-504a7aff7a37' \
