# Submit a Data Request

This phase of the tutorial demonstrates how to submit a data request that extracts service data from within a BIM 360 account or Forma hub. In this tutorial, your data request will be a recurring request that spawns a job once every week, and returns extracted data for seven different services.

## Before You Begin
- [Register an app](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps)
- Acquire a [3-legged OAuth token](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) with `data:create`, `data:read`, and `data:write` scopes. The token’s authenticated user must have executive overview permissions or project administrator permissions.
- Verify that you have access to a relevant BIM 360 account or Forma hub that contains at least one project. If you don’t know your account ID, you can derive it from your hub ID: Use [GET hubs](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/hubs-GET/) in the Data Management API to retrieve your hub ID. Remove the initial “b.” from the hub ID to get your account ID. For example, a hub ID of `b.c8b0c73d-3ae9` translates to an account ID of `c8b0c73d-3ae9`.

## Step 1: Determine Your Data Parameters

To make a data request, you’ll have to provide request parameter values that correctly specify the type of data extraction you want the Data Connector service to perform and to provide other useful information stored with the request:
- `description` contains a text string describing the data request, in this case `"My Weekly Extract"`.
- `scheduleInterval` specifies the interval unit we’ll use for scheduling. In this case we measure in weeks, so the value is `WEEK`.
- `reoccuringInterval` specifies the number of units to wait between job spawns. Because we want this request to spawn a job once every week, the value is `1`.
- `effectiveFrom` and `effectiveTo` define the starting and ending times for the recurring jobs. It’s during this time that the jobs spawn and execute, starting on the `effectiveFrom` time and ending on the `effectiveTo` time. These two values define date and time in ISO 8601 format. For this example, we’ll set a one-year interval. Our example values: `2020-11-19T16:00:00Z` start time, `2021-11-19T16:00:00Z` end time.
- `serviceGroups` defines the scope of the data extraction for this data request: the services for which we want to examine data. In this case, we look at admin, issues, locations, submittals, cost, and rfis. You can also specify `all` to extract data for all service groups. Note that the admin service covers both project and account/hub administration.
- `projectId` specifies which project to extract data from. Usage depends on the permissions level of the authenticated user: Executive Overview permissions — (optional) If neither `projectId` or `projectIdList` is specified, the request will apply to all projects in the user’s account/hub.
- Project Administrator permissions — (required) If neither `projectId` or `projectIdList` is specified, the request will fail.
- `projectIdList` specifies the list of projects to extract data from. `projectId` can be omitted if `projectIdList` is used. If both are provided, `projectIdList` takes precedence. The user needs to have either Executive Overview permission, or Project Administrator permission in all the projects provided in the list. Otherwise, the request will fail.
- `projectStatus` specifies the scope of the projects based on the project status. Use `active` if only data extraction from active projects is required.

## Step 2: Create a Data Request

Create a data request using the [POST requests](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/reference/http/data-connector-requests-POST/) endpoint, specifying the account/hub ID. This tutorial demonstrates recurring data requests for two scenarios:
- Retrieving data for a specific list of projects using `projectIdList`.
- Retrieving data for all active projects in the account/hub using `projectStatus`.

### Scenario 1: Requesting Data for Specific Projects

If the user wants to extract data for specific projects, include the `projectIdList` field in the request payload. This field specifies up to 50 project IDs.

### Request

```
curl -X POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/data-connector/v1/accounts/<accountId>/requests' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <authToken>' \
-d '

{
    "description": "My Weekly Extract",
    "scheduleInterval": "WEEK",
    "reoccuringInterval": 1,
    "effectiveFrom": "2020-11-19T16:00:00Z",
    "effectiveTo": "2021-11-19T16:00:00Z",
    "serviceGroups": ["admin", "issues", "locations", "submittals", "cost", "rfis"],
    "projectIdList": [
    "ffffffff-1f51-4b26-a6b7-6ac0639cb138",
    "aaaaaaaa-1f51-4b26-a6b7-6ac0639cb138"        ]
}'
```

### Response

```
{
    "id": "55e410c5-4294-44ce-becf-68e1cfd6738c",
    "isActive": true,
    "accountId": "872264f8-2433-498d-8d36-16649ecb13fe",
    "projectId": null,
    "projectIdList": [
    "ffffffff-1f51-4b26-a6b7-6ac0639cb138",
    "aaaaaaaa-1f51-4b26-a6b7-6ac0639cb138"
  ],
    "description": "My Weekly Extract",
    "createdBy": "73f00c25-a5f9-4c05-861d-ce56d54fa649",
    "createdByEmail": "your.name@autodesk.com",
    "updatedBy": "73f00c25-a5f9-4c05-861d-ce56d54fa649",
    "scheduleInterval": "WEEK",
    "reoccuringInterval": 1,
    "effectiveFrom": "2020-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "effectiveTo": "2021-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "nextExecAt": "2020-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "serviceGroups": [
        "admin",
        "issues",
        "locations",
        "submittals",
        "cost",
        "rfis"
    ],
    "callbackUrl": null,
    "lastQueuedAt": null,
    "updatedAt": "2020-11-19T16:32:13.545Z",
    "createdAt": "2020-11-19T16:32:13.545Z",
    "deletedAt": null    }
```

### Scenario 2: Requesting Data for Active Projects

If the user has executive overview permissions and wants to retrieve data for all active projects in the account/hub, use the `projectStatus` field.

### Request

```
curl -X POST 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/data-connector/v1/accounts/<accountId>/requests' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <authToken>' \
-d '

{
    "description": "My Weekly Extract",
    "scheduleInterval": "WEEK",
    "reoccuringInterval": 1,
    "effectiveFrom": "2020-11-19T16:00:00Z",
    "effectiveTo": "2021-11-19T16:00:00Z",
    "serviceGroups": ["admin", "issues", "locations", "submittals", "cost", "rfis"],
    "projectStatus": "active"
}'
```

### Response

```
{
    "id": "55e410c5-4294-44ce-becf-68e1cfd6738c",
    "isActive": true,
    "accountId": "872264f8-2433-498d-8d36-16649ecb13fe",
    "description": "My Weekly Extract",
    "createdBy": "73f00c25-a5f9-4c05-861d-ce56d54fa649",
    "createdByEmail": "your.name@autodesk.com",
    "updatedBy": "73f00c25-a5f9-4c05-861d-ce56d54fa649",
    "scheduleInterval": "WEEK",
    "reoccuringInterval": 1,
    "effectiveFrom": "2020-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "effectiveTo": "2021-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "nextExecAt": "2020-11-19T16:00:00.000Z",
    "serviceGroups": [
        "admin",
        "issues",
        "locations",
        "submittals",
        "cost",
        "rfis"
    ],
    "callbackUrl": null,
    "lastQueuedAt": null,
    "updatedAt": "2020-11-19T16:32:13.545Z",
    "createdAt": "2020-11-19T16:32:13.545Z",
"deletedAt": null,
"projectStatus": "active"
```

The response reports the data request settings and status, and includes an `id` value that provides the data request ID. Use the data request ID to specify this data request when calling other Data Connector API endpoints. If you don’t save the ID, you can query the API (as we’ll do in the next example) for the data request IDs of your data requests currently stored by the Data Connector service.

Notice that optional field values not set in the request get set to default values.
