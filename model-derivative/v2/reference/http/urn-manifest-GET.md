# modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest

Retrieves the manifest of the specified source design.

The manifest is a JSON file containing information about all the derivatives translated from the specified source design, including the URNs of the derivatives, the translation status of each derivative, and other details.

The first time you translate a source design, the Model Derivative service creates a manifest for that design. Thereafter, every time you translate that source design, even to a different format, the Model Derivative service updates the same manifest rather than creating a new one. The manifest acts as a central registry for all the derivatives of your source design created through the Model Derivative service.

When the Model Derivative service starts a translation job (as a result of a request you make using [Create Translation Job](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/jobs/job-POST/)), it updates the manifest at regular intervals. You can use the manifest to check the status and progress of each derivative being generated. When multiple derivatives have been requested, each may complete at a different time. Each derivative has its own `status` attribute. The manifest also contains an overall `status` attribute. The overall `status` becomes `complete` when the `status` of all individual derivatives become complete.

Once the translation status of a derivative is `complete`, you can download the derivative.

**Note:** You cannot download 3D SVF2 derivatives.

## Resource Information

| Method and URI | GET https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/designdata/{urn}/manifest |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication Context | User context optional |
| Required OAuth Scopes | `data:read` `viewables:read` |
| Data Format | JSON |

### Request

## Headers

| Authorization*string | Must be `Bearer <token>`, where `<token>` is a two-legged access token obtained via a [Client Credentials Grant flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-2-legged-token/), or a three-legged access token obtained via an [Authorization Code flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) or a [Secure Service Account (SSA) flow](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/ssa/v1/tutorials/getting-started-with-ssa/task3-generate-3-legged-access-token/).
The SSA flow is designed for headless server-to-server operations. While it functions like a two-legged flow (no user interaction), it is classified as three-legged because it preserves user context. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encodingstring | A comma separated list of the algorithms you want the response to be encoded in, specified in the order of preference.
If you specify `gzip` or `*`, content is compressed and returned in gzip format. |
| regionstring | Specifies the data center where the manifest and derivatives of the specified source design are stored. Possible values are:

`US` - (Default) Data center for the US region.
`EMEA` - Data center for the European Union, Middle East, and Africa.
`AUS` - Data center for the Australia region.
`CAN` - Data center for the Canada region.
`DEU` - Data center for the Germany region.
`IND` - Data center for the India region.
`JPN` - Data center for the Japan region.
`GBR` - Data center for the United Kingdom region. |

### Request

## URI Parameters

| urnstring | The URL-safe Base64 encoded URN of the source design. This value is used as the `urn` URI parameter in operations to access data for this source design. |
| --- | --- |

### Response

## HTTP Status Code Summary

| 200OK | The manifest was successfully retrieved. |
| --- | --- |
| 400Bad Request | The server was unable to process the request. The syntax of the request is malformed or the request is missing a required header. Do not repeat the request without fixing the issue. The response body may indicate what is wrong with the request. |
| 401Unauthorized | The supplied authorization header was not valid or the supplied token scope was not acceptable. Verify authentication and try again. |
| 403Forbidden | The request was successfully validated but lacking the required permissions. Verify your credentials and permissions before you send this request again. |
| 404Not Found | The requested resource was not found. Review the request and try again. |
| 500Internal Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on the server, preventing it from completing your request. Please try again later. If the issue persists, contact the support team for assistance. |

The following examples return raw HTTP headers and JSON objects. For a more developer-friendly experience, consider using our [TypeScript SDK](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/typescript-sdk/) or [.NET SDK](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/dot-net-sdk). Both provide strongly typed data with IntelliSense support, offering code completion, error checking, and tooltips that reduce the need to reference JSON schemas.

## Example 1

This example shows what happens when you request a manifest before translation has begun.
