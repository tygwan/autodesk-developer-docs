# Task 2 – Upload Source File to OSS

The Object Storage Service (OSS) is a generic Cloud Storage Service that is part of the Data Management API. In this task, you upload a Zip file containing an Inventor model to OSS.
While you can use any model, we recommend that you use the zip file we provide ( _Stapler.zip_ ) for this walkthrough. You can download this file from the _walkthrough_data_ folder of the GitHub repository containing the Postman Collection for this walkthrough.

By the end of this task you will be able to:
- Create a Bucket to store the files.
- Obtain a signed URL to upload a file to the bucket.
- Upload a file to the Bucket.
- Obtain the URN of the uploaded file.
- Convert the URN to a Base64-encoded URN.

You will use the following operations in this task:

| Operation | HTTP Request |
| --- | --- |
| [Create a Bucket](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST/) | POST /buckets |
| [Get a Signed URL to Upload a File](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-GET) | GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/objects/{objectKey}/signeds3upload |
| [Finalize File Upload](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3upload-POST) | POST /buckets/{bucketKey}/objects/{objectKey}/signeds3upload |

## Step 1 - Create a Bucket

Before you upload a file to OSS you must create a Bucket. Once the Bucket is created, you can store files in it as Objects.

### Request

```
curl -X POST \
    'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'x-ads-region: US' \
    -d '{
        "bucketKey": "<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>",
        "access": "full",
        "policyKey": "transient"
        }'
```

**Notes:**
- You must specify a name for your Bucket. Replace `<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>` with a name for the Bucket.
- Bucket keys must consist of only lower case characters, numbers 0-9, and the underscore (_) character.
- The Bucket key must be unique throughout the OSS service. If the Bucket name is already in use (even by another user) the server returns a `409 Conflict` error. In such a case, retry with another Bucket name.

### Response

```
{
    "bucketKey": "<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>",
    "bucketOwner": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
    "createdDate": 1571296694595,
    "permissions": [
        {
            "authId": "T05H372IE11Kmkksdh73ndj0qie2f6nib",
            "access": "full"
        }
    ],
    "policyKey": "transient"
}
```

## Step 2 - Obtain signed URL

To upload a file to an OSS bucket, you need to have a signed upload URL. To obtain a signed URL:

### Request

```
curl -X GET \
    'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets/<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>/objects/<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>/signeds3upload?minutesExpiration=<LIFESPAN_OF_URL>' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Notes:**
- Replace <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> with the access token you obtained in Task 1.
- Replace <LIFESPAN_OF_URL> with 10. This will ensure that the signed URL that is returned will be valid for 10 minutes.
- Replace <YOUR_OBJECT_KEY> with _Stapler.zip_, which is the name of the file we recommend that you upload.

### Response

```
  {
      "uploadKey": "<YOUR_UPLOAD_KEY>",
      "uploadExpiration": "2022-04-08T00:00:00Z",
      "urlExpiration": "2022-04-06T17:59:46Z",
      "urls": ["<SIGNED_UPLOAD_URL>"],
      "location": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets/<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>/objects/<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>"
  }
```

Note down the values returned for `uploadKey` <YOUR_UPLOAD_KEY> and `urls` <SIGNED_UPLOAD_URL>. You will use these values in subsequent requests.

## Step 3 - Upload the file
- Download the file _Stapler.zip_ from [https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-tutorial-postman/tree/master/ModelDerivative_06/walkthrough_data](https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-tutorial-postman/tree/master/ModelDerivative_06/walkthrough_data).
- Send a request to upload the file to the Bucket.

### Request

```
curl -X PUT \
    '<SIGNED_UPLOAD_URL>'\
    --data-binary '@<PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE_TO_UPLOAD>'
```

## Step 4 - Finalize Upload
- To make the uploaded file available for download, you must finalize the upload. To complete the upload:

### Request

```
curl -X POST \
    'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets/<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>/objects/<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>/signeds3upload' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "ossbucketKey": "<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>",
        "ossSourceFileObjectKey": "<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>",
        "access": "full",
        "uploadKey": "<YOUR_UPLOAD_KEY>"
        }'
```

### Response

```
{
    "bucketKey": "<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>",
    "objectId": "<YOUR_OBJECT_ID>",
    "objectKey": "<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>",
    "size": "7221597",
    "contentType": "application/octet-stream",
    "location": "https://developer.api.autodesk.com/oss/v2/buckets/<YOUR_BUCKET_KEY>/objects/<YOUR_OBJECT_KEY>",
    "permissions": [
        {
            "authId": "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "access": "full"
        }
    ],
    "policyKey": "transient"
}
```

## Step 3 - Convert the Inventor model URN to a Base64-encoded URN

Most Model Derivative requests require the URN of the source file to be a Base64-encoded URN.
- Use [this online tool](http://www.freeformatter.com/base64-encoder.html) to convert the URN of the source file (The value of `objectId` you obtained in the previous step).

For further information, see the full list of [Base64 variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Variants_summary_table).

We recommend using the unpadded option (RFC 6920), since it uses URL-safe alphabets. The following example shows a URN, its Base64-encoded form, and its URL safe Base64-encoded form:

| raw | `urn:adsk.objects:os.object:md_tute_01/Stapler.zip` |
| --- | --- |
| Base64 | `dXJuOmFkc2sub2JqZWN0czpvcy5vYmplY3Q6bWRfdHV0ZV8wMS9TdGFwbGVyLnppcA==` |
| URL-safe Base64 (no padding) | `dXJuOmFkc2sub2JqZWN0czpvcy5vYmplY3Q6bWRfdHV0ZV8wMS9TdGFwbGVyLnppcA` |
