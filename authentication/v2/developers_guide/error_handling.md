# Error Handling

## Authentication Errors

Authentication errors are typically indicated by a 4xx HTTP status code in the response header. The response body provides details of the error that occurred. The body structure of the error response for authentication errors are as below:

| developerMessagestring | A short explanation, typically meant to assist diagnose the cause of the error. |
| --- | --- |
| userMessagestring | A short, generic description of the error, meant for an end-user audience. |
| errorCodestring | A code that identifies the error type. |
| more infostring | A URL to a location that provides more information about the occurrence of the error. |

### Example

```
{
  "developerMessage":"Rate limit of this API request is exceeded.",
  "userMessage":" ",
  "errorCode":"ERR-001",
  "more info":"http://developer-stg.api.autodesk.co/documentation/v2/errors/ERR-001"
}
```

## HTTP Status Response Codes

APS services use standard HTTP status response codes in the response header to indicate whether a request completed successfully or not. A 2xx type response indicates success. A 4xx type response indicates a failure in handling a request. For example, an error caused by a request containing an invalid parameter. A 5xx type response usually indicates an internal server error.

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | The request has succeeded. |
| 201 | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created. |
| 202 | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. |
| 204 | The server has successfully fulfilled the request, there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. |
| 207 | A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple resources in situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate. |
| 304 | There was no new data to return. Typically used to indicate that the cached version of the response is still valid. |
| 400 | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. Typical when there is a syntax error in the request. The response payload body provides further details of the error. |
| 401 | Missing or incorrect authentication credentials. |
| 403 | The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. The response payload body provides further details of the error. |
| 404 | The requested resource does not exist. Sometimes, when it is prudent to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client, a 403 error may be generated instead of this error. |
| 406 | An invalid format is specified in the request. |
| 429 | The application’s rate limit for the resource has been exhausted. |
| 500 | Something is broken. This is usually a temporary error, for example in a high load situation or if an endpoint is temporarily having issues. |
| 502 | API is down, or being upgraded. |
