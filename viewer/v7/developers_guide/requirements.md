# Visualization System and Device Requirements

Minimum system and device requirements are necessary for basic visualization workflows and viewing simple models.

Recommended devices are better suited for reliable and performant visualization of large or complex models, including multi-model viewing. RAM, CPU, and GPU requirements depend on project size and complexity and have a significant impact on performance.

Beyond hardware, factors such as internet speed and background applications can also impact viewing performance.

## Desktop

### Minimum System Requirements

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 2.3 GHz or faster processor |   |
| RAM | 8 GB RAM |   |
| Browser | Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge |   |

### Recommended Device Requirements

| Component | Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 3.0+ GHz or faster processor with 16-24 cores |   |
| Operating System | Windows, macOS, Linux | We do not recommend using Chromebooks or other specialized systems. |
| Graphics | High-end discrete GPU |   |
| RAM | 16-32 GB RAM |   |
| Browser | Latest 64-bit Chrome version | Ensure that the display is using the correct graphics card. On certain devices, using a discrete GPU for the browser requires enabling it in Windows settings. |

### Additional Recommended Settings

| Setting | Recommendation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WebGPU | Ensure WebGPU is enabled in the web viewer settings when viewing large or complex models. | If it cannot be turned on, the GPU, browser, or other system settings may not be optimized for viewing. |
| Target Frame Rate | If many objects are dropping out of view while navigating a model, adjust the **Target Frame Rate** setting. | To reduce objects dropping out of view, lower the target frame rate. |
