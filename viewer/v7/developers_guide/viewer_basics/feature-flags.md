# Feature Flags

Feature flags let you enable or expose optional capabilities of the Viewer. They come in two flavors:
- **Enabling a functionality**: turning the flag on activates the feature directly.
- **Exposing a capability**: turning the flag on makes an option available (for example, a settings toggle), but the user still has to opt in before the capability is actually used.

Feature flags are managed by the static class `Autodesk.Viewing.FeatureFlags`. It exposes `set()`, `isEnabled()`, and `print()` — see the [FeatureFlags](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/FeatureFlags) reference for the full method signatures.

Note

Feature flags must be set **before** you call `Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer()`. After initialization the flags become **immutable**: calling `set()` afterwards logs a warning and has no effect.

## Setting a Flag

Set the feature flags you need before calling `Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer()`, then create your Viewer instance inside the initializer callback.

```
var options = {
    env: 'AutodeskProduction2',
    api: 'streamingV2',
    getAccessToken: function(onTokenReady) {
        var token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN';
        var timeInSeconds = 3600; // Use value provided by APS Authentication (OAuth) API
        onTokenReady(token, timeInSeconds);
    }
};

// Set feature flags BEFORE initialization.
Autodesk.Viewing.FeatureFlags.set(Autodesk.Viewing.PublicFeatureFlags.SceneAPI, true);

Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer(options, function() {
    var htmlDiv = document.getElementById('forgeViewer');
    var viewer = new Autodesk.Viewing.GuiViewer3D(htmlDiv);
    viewer.start();
});
```

## Available Public Flags

The publicly available flag identifiers are exposed as constants on `Autodesk.Viewing.PublicFeatureFlags` — see the [PublicFeatureFlags](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/PublicFeatureFlags) reference for the full list. You can pass either the constant or its string value to `set()`.

## Scene API

The Scene API is gated behind the `PublicFeatureFlags.SceneAPI` feature flag, which is **disabled by default**. Enabling it switches models over to the instance-collection code path and unlocks `Model.getInstances()`.

Enable it before initialization, using either the constant or the string value:

```
// Using the public constant
Autodesk.Viewing.FeatureFlags.set(Autodesk.Viewing.PublicFeatureFlags.SceneAPI, true);

// ...or the equivalent string value
Autodesk.Viewing.FeatureFlags.set('SCENE_API', true);
```

Note

Models created without a loader (dynamic models) always use the Scene API code path, regardless of whether `PublicFeatureFlags.SceneAPI` is set.

## WebGPU

WebGPU is an alternative rendering backend that uses modern browser graphics technology instead of WebGL. It is not controlled through the public feature flags described above; instead, when it is available in your Viewer build, end users choose it themselves.
- Users toggle it from the Viewer’s **Settings** panel via the **WebGPU Graphics** option.
- The choice is stored in the browser as the `webgpu` preference and persists across sessions, which also allows users to opt out.
- Switching the renderer takes effect after the page is reloaded.
- If the current browser does not support WebGPU, the option is shown as unavailable.
