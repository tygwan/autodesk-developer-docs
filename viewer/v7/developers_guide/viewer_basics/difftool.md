# Using DiffTool to Compare Models

The DiffTool extension provides UI controls for comparing 2D and 3D models.

## Examples

```
viewer.loadExtension('Autodesk.DiffTool')
```

### Usage

Using the DiffTool, you can compare the differences between models in Viewer SDK. The DiffTool shows three kinds of changes to the primary model:
- Added: Shows objects that have been added to the primary model.
- Removed: Shows objects that have been removed from the primary model.
- Modified: Shows objects that have been changed in the primary model

There are three modification types:
- Geometry: The geometry data has been modified.
- Transformation: The geometry transformation has been modified.
- Attribute: One or more properties of the geometry has been modified.

### Configuring DiffTool LMV extension

A list of all configuration options for the DiffTool LMV extension:

| primaryModels*Autodesk.Viewing.Model | An array of loaded “Autodesk.Viewing.Model” instances that are compared by the DiffTool. |
| --- | --- |
| diffModels*Autodesk.Viewing.Model | An array of other loaded Autodesk.Viewing.Model instances that participate in the diff operation as the previous state. Length must match primaryModels to define pairs of models to be compared. |
| versionA*string | Version identifier for the primary models, such as “2”, “Version 2”, or “02/26/2018”. Note that you must provide a localized string if you are using something other than numbers or dates. |
| versionB*string | Version identifier of the diff models, usually a previous version |
| mimeType*string | ‘application/vnd.autodesk.revit’: Revit
‘application/vnd.autodesk.r360’: Revit
‘application/vnd.autodesk.fusion360’: For Fusion 360
‘application/vnd.autodesk.f3d’: For Fusion 360
‘application/vnd.autodesk.inventor.assembly’: For Inventor (IAM)
‘application/vnd.autodesk.navisworks’`: For Navisworks (NWD)
‘application/vnd.autodesk.cad’: For IFC
‘application/vnd.autodesk.dxf’: For DXF
‘application/vnd.autodesk.autocad.dwg’: For DWG |
| propertyFilter{Object.<string,Array<string>} | An object representing a category and properties key-value pair to ignore for diff computation. Example: {“Dimensions”:[“Area”,”Length”], “Mechanical - Flow”:[“Flow”]} |

#### Using LMV initialization options

## Examples

```
var config = {
    availableDiffModes: ['overlay', 'sidebyside'],
    diffModels: A,
    primaryModels: B,
    mimeType: 'application/vnd.autodesk.revit',
    diffMode: 'overlay',
    versionA: 'A',
    versionB: 'B',
    propertyFilter: { "Category1": [ "Property1", "Property2" ] }
};

viewer.loadExtension("Autodesk.DiffTool", config);
```
