# Controlling Viewer State

This example adds a button named **Toggle Explode** to the UI. The button toggles between an explode value of 0 and a second preset explode value. This example uses a 50% explode value (0.5) for the second value.

This is accomplished by adding a click event listener to the new `explodeButton`, which calls `viewer.explode()`. The click event lets you switch between the specified explode values.

**Tip** Open the example in CodePen and try different explode scale values.
