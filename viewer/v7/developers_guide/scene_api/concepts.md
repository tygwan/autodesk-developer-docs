# Concepts

## What is the Scene API?

The Scene API is the unified API for creating and placing custom 3D
content in the viewer. It lets you:
- Build models entirely in code — no file upload required.
- Add geometry, assign materials, and position content programmatically.
- Modify the appearance of instances in loaded models.
- Place custom content on overlay or underlay render layers.

Custom content is organized as individual renderable units that
combine a geometry shape, a material, and a transform. You create and
manipulate instances through the [InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/) API.

## Core Types

This section is a quick reference. Each type is covered in depth in the
example pages that follow.

### Model

A [Model](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/) is a container that can
hold content loaded from a design file _or_ content you construct yourself
at runtime — the rendering pipeline treats both the same way. It holds an [InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/) (its instances), an optional
object tree (its logical object hierarchy), and an optional scene graph of
[Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/) groups.

### InstanceCollection3D

The primary API surface for the model’s content. Access it via
`model.getInstances()`. It stores all instances in the model as a flat,
addressable collection.

### Instance

The central renderable unit: **geometry + material + transform + visibility**.
There is no `Instance` class to construct directly — the collection manages
the storage and addresses instances by id. Think of an instance as a single
draw call: one shape, one material, one position in the world.

### Geometry (BufferGeometry)

Vertex data describing a shape. A [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/) holds typed-array
attributes:
- `position` (3D vertex positions, required)
- `normal` (surface normals, required for lit materials)
- `uv` (texture coordinates, optional)
- `color` (per-vertex color, optional)

Geometry is covered in the **Geometry and First Render** section ([Hello Triangle](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/hello-triangle/) through [Working with Buffers](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/working-with-buffers/)).

### Material

Controls the appearance of individual instances. There are four material types: [StandardMaterial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/StandardMaterial/)
for shaded (Phong) opaque or transparent surfaces that respond to scene
lighting, [UnlitMaterial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/UnlitMaterial/) for flat color or texture with no lighting (HUD
elements, labels), [LineMaterial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/LineMaterial/) for line primitives (wireframes, guides,
annotations), and [PointsMaterial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/PointsMaterial/) for point-cloud or particle rendering.

These are covered in the **Materials** section.

### Transform

A per-instance [Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) that defines the transformation relative to the model space. The matrix defines
translation, rotation and scale of the instance. If not specified, the instance is placed at the model origin with no rotation or scale.

### ObjectTree

An object represents a logical model component (assembly, part, room) and is identified by a `dbId`.
Each object can have one or more instances as its renderable representation.

Objects are structured in a hierarchy called ObjectTree. This hierarchy may be used to describe how parts are
assembled — which components belong to which sub-assemblies.

Access it via [Model.getObjectTree](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/#getObjectTree/), which returns an object tree.
To iterate the instances that belong to a given object, use
`objectTree.enumNodeInstances(dbId, callback)`.

The object tree is covered in depth in the **Loaded Models** section ([Wrapping Loaded Instances](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/wrapping-loaded-instances/)).

### Scene Graph

An optional, programmatically-built tree of [Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/) groups that lets you group
instances under a common transform. It lets you interact with instances and
groups of instances in an object-oriented way, for example, to move a whole
sub-assembly by translating its parent node.

The scene graph is not present on a model by default — you build it only
when you need it.

See the **Scene Graph** section for usage details ([Building a Hierarchy](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/building-a-hierarchy/)) and ([Wrapping Loaded Instances](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/wrapping-loaded-instances/)).

## Object vs. Instance

The Scene API exposes two parallel concepts that are easy to confuse:
- **Object**: A _logical_ model component — an assembly, a part, a room. Objects are identified by a `dbId` (database id), can be selected, and carry property-database metadata. Viewer features such as isolate, hide, and theming operate on objects via their `dbId`.
- **Instance** A _renderable_ piece of geometry with a material and a transform. One object can consist of one or more instances — for example, a door object might have separate instances for the knob (brass material) and the frame (wood material), each with its own geometry and appearance.

Concrete example:

A Door object has `dbId=42`. It has two instances:
- Instance A — door frame, wood material.
- Instance B — door knob, brass material.

Calling `viewer.isolate([42])` affects the _object_ (both instances
disappear from the screen). Calling `instances.setMaterial(instanceB_id,
goldMat)` affects only the knob’s _instance_, leaving the frame unchanged.

As a rule of thumb: customize _appearance_ at the instance level; organize
and query _design intent_ at the object level.

Each concept has its own place to live, and keeping the two straight is the
single most important conceptual step in the Scene API:
- The **Object Tree** is a hierarchy of _objects_, identified by `dbId`. Use it for selection, property queries, and isolate/hide by part. A loaded model has an object tree; a fully dynamic model you build in code does not.
- The **InstanceCollection** is a flat list of _instances_ — it has no parent/child relationships. Use it for geometry assignment, materials, transforms, and visibility.
- The **Scene Graph** is an optional, programmatic hierarchy of transform groups you build yourself, for animation, reparenting, and grouping assemblies. It has no relationship to the object tree.

## How Content Reaches the Screen

There are two ways to make a model visible in the viewer.

**Main content**

Use [Viewer3D.showModel](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#showModel/) to add a model to the main scene. This is also
where loaded models normally live, and it’s where most
examples place app-created content. Models in the main scene are rendered
progressively (across multiple frames) to maintain a constant frame rate.

**Render layers (overlays and underlays)**

Use `viewer.layers` to place content on a named render layer with explicit
render ordering. Models in render layers are rendered all at once every
frame. As a result, render layers are not suitable for complex models.

There are two types of render layers:
- **Main** — rendered before or after the main scene content into the main render target.
- **Overlay** — rendered after each progressive frame of the main scene and blended with the main scene content. Overlays can be rendered independent of the main scene.

See the **Render layers** section for details.
