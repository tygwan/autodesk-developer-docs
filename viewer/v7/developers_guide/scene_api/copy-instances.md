# Copy Instances

While [Wrapping Loaded Instances](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/scene_api/wrapping-loaded-instances/)
only changes loaded instances, sometimes you need a true copy —
separate geometry and material in a new model, independent from the source.

This example reads
geometry and material from a loaded model’s [InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/)
and reproduces them in a fresh dynamic model. The copy can then be manipulated (moved, recolored, hidden) without affecting
the original because it lives in an entirely separate [InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/).

The workflow mirrors the wrapping pattern: resolve instance ids from dbIds via the object tree, then clone geometry and
material from [InstanceCollection3D.getGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#getGeometry/) /
[InstanceCollection3D.getMaterial](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#getMaterial/) on the **source**
collection and pass them to [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/) on
the **new** one, offsetting the transform so both copies stay visible. Geometries and materials are owned by their model and
can’t be shared across models — always clone first.

This is useful for snapshots that outlive the original load state.

**Opt-In feature — required for loaded models.**

Enable the Scene API before `Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer`:

```
FeatureFlags.set(Autodesk.Viewing.PublicFeatureFlags.SceneAPI, true);

Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer(options, function() {
    // ... create viewer, load document ...
});
```

## Source

**Copy instances into a new dynamic model**

```
// Create a new dynamic model to hold the copied instances.
const copyModel = new av.Model();
viewer.showModel(copyModel);
const copyCollection = copyModel.getInstances();

// Copy geometry from the source into the new collection.
// We apply a translation so the copies are separate from
// the originals.
const offsetTransform = new avm.Matrix4()
  .makeTranslation(0, 0, 10);

const mat = new avs.StandardMaterial({color: '#ffff00'});
const tmpMatrix = new avm.Matrix4();
for (const instanceId of instanceIds) {
  const geom = instances.getGeometry(instanceId);

  // Compose original transform with offset
  const origTransform = instances.getTransformWorld(
    instanceId, tmpMatrix
  );
  const copyTransform = offsetTransform.clone();
  copyTransform.multiply(origTransform);

  copyCollection.add(geom.clone(), mat, copyTransform);
}
```
