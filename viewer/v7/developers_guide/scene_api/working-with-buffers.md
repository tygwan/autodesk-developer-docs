# Working with Buffers

In the previous examples you learned how to define geometry and pass it to the viewer. After the viewer takes ownership of the geometry,
it may optimize the layout of the vertex buffers for GPU efficiency. This example shows how to access vertex data safely.

Once you pass that geometry to [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/), the viewer
optimizes the buffers. After that point the [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) object is still
accessible, but the internal layout and data may have changed.

Whenever you need to read vertex data back — for example to compute a bounding box,
extract surface samples, or debug geometry values, you cannot read the data directly.
The safe pattern is to call [BufferGeometry.getPosition](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#getPosition/) with the vertex index to read each vertex’s position into a
[Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/). For normals there are similar methods. Those methods work correctly independently of the geometry’s internal representation, so the
same loop body works regardless of when you read the geometry.

In this example we create a sphere via [GeometryFactory](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/), computes a manual bounding box before and
after calling [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/) using [BufferGeometry.getVertexCount](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#getVertexCount/) / [BufferGeometry.getPosition](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#getPosition/) iteration, and then visualizes the bounding box as a
wireframe overlay using [BufferGeometry.setEdgeIndices](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#setEdgeIndices/). The two computed boxes are identical — that is the
whole point — even though the geometry’s internal structure has changed between the two reads.

## Source

**Layout-safe bounding box computation**

[BufferGeometry.getVertexCount](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#getVertexCount/) returns the number of vertices in the geometry, and
[BufferGeometry.getPosition](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#getPosition/) writes the position of a given vertex into the supplied
[Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/). Both methods account for the geometry’s current layout internally, so the same loop
works whether the data is non-interleaved or interleaved.

```
function computeBoundingBoxManual(geom) {
  const count = geom.getVertexCount();
  const pos = new avm.Vector3();
  const box = new avm.Box3();

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    geom.getPosition(i, pos);
    box.expandByPoint(pos);
  }

  return box;
}
```

**Wireframe bounding-box overlay using edge indices**

A geometry can carry two separate index lists: the triangle index list ([BufferGeometry.setIndices](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#setIndices/)) drives
shaded rendering, and the edge index list ([BufferGeometry.setEdgeIndices](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/#setEdgeIndices/)) drives line rendering when
[Viewer3D.setDisplayEdges](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#setDisplayEdges/) is active. The wireframe box below uses only edge indices — the
triangle index list is set to an empty array so the renderer draws no filled faces.

**Main: compute box before and after `InstanceCollection3D.add </en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/>`_, then visualize**

```
// --- 1. Create a sphere via GeometryFactory ---
const geom = avs.GeometryFactory.createSphere(2, 32, 16);

// --- 2. Manual bounding box (Original Data) ---
let manualBox = computeBoundingBoxManual(geom);
console.log('Manual bounding box (', geom.isCommitted()
    ? 'optimized data' : 'original data', '):', manualBox);

// --- 3. Visualize Sphere ---
const sphereMat = new avs.StandardMaterial({
  color: 0x4488ff,
});

// Geometry is added to the viewer and optimized
// internally.
instances.add(geom, sphereMat);

// --- 4. Manual bounding box (Optimized Data) ---
manualBox = computeBoundingBoxManual(geom);
console.log('Manual bounding box (', geom.isCommitted()
  ? 'optimized data': 'original data', '):', manualBox);

const wireGeom = createBoundsWireframe(manualBox);
const wireMat = new avs.UnlitMaterial({ color: 0xff4444 });
instances.add(wireGeom, wireMat);

viewer.setDisplayEdges(true);
```
