# Managing Instances

All previous examples call [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/) once and leave the scene unchanged.
Real applications need to mutate content at runtime — replacing a material when a status changes,
repositioning an object in response to user input, or removing items that are no longer relevant.
[InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/) exposes create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for exactly this purpose, each
addressable by the numeric instance id returned from [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/).

This example animates through the following operations:
- adding three spheres
- getting the transform of an instance
- swapping a material
- replacing geometry entirely
- moving an instance with a new transform
- removing a single instance
- clearing the scene to restart the cycle

After each mutation the example calls [Viewer3D.refresh](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#refresh/) to update the view.

## Source

**Create, Read, Update, Delete sequence**

Each element of the array performs one [InstanceCollection3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/) operation. [InstanceCollection3D.add](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#add/) returns an
instance id stored in `instanceIds` for use by subsequent steps.

First we create three spheres with different colors and transforms.

```
// Step 0: add red sphere (left)
() => {
    instanceIds.push(
        instances.add(sphere, matRed, transformA)
    );
    console.log('added red sphere at left');
},
// Step 1: add green sphere (center)
() => {
    instanceIds.push(
        instances.add(sphere, matGreen, transformB)
    );
    console.log('added green sphere at center');
},
// Step 2: add blue sphere (right)
() => {
    instanceIds.push(
        instances.add(sphere, matBlue, transformC)
    );
    console.log('added blue sphere at right');
},
```

We read the transform of the left sphere for later modification and log it to the console.

```
// Step 3: getTransformWorld - sphere (left)
() => {
    instances.getTransformWorld(instanceIds[0], transform);
    console.log('left sphere transform',  transform);
},
```

Here we show how to change materials, geometries and transformations of existing instances.

```
// Step 4: setMaterial — green → yellow
() => {
    instances.setMaterial(
        instanceIds[1], matYellow
    );
    console.log('center sphere now yellow');
},
// Step 5: setGeometry — blue sphere → box
() => {
    instances.setGeometry(instanceIds[2], box);
    console.log('right sphere replaced with box');
},
// Step 6: setTransformWorld — move red sphere upward
() => {
    instances.setTransformWorld(
        instanceIds[0],
        transform.multiply(
            new Matrix4().makeTranslation(
                0, 1, 0
            )
        )
    );
    console.log('red sphere moved up');
},
```

Instances can be removed individually with [InstanceCollection3D.remove](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceCollection3D/#remove/) or in batches with an array: `InstanceCollection.remove([id1, id2, id3])`.

```
// Step 7: remove — delete the box
() => {
    instances.remove(instanceIds.pop());
    console.log('right instance deleted');
},
// Step 8: reset — remove remaining, restart cycle
() => {
    instances.remove(instanceIds);
    instanceIds = [];
    console.log('— scene cleared, restarting —');
}
```
