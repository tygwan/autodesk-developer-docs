# GeometryFactory

## new GeometryFactory()

Factory helpers for creating standard geometry primitives as BufferGeometry. Each method returns a mutable BufferGeometry with positions, normals, UVs, indices and optional edge indices pre-filled.

# Methods

## createSphere(radius, widthSegments, heightSegments)

Creates a sphere geometry.

### Parameters

| radius*number | Sphere radius |
| --- | --- |
| widthSegments*number | Number of horizontal segments (min 3). |
| heightSegments*number | Number of vertical segments (min 2). |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |

## createBox(width, height, depth, generateEdges)

Creates a box geometry.

### Parameters

| width*number | Box width |
| --- | --- |
| height*number | Box height |
| depth*number | Box depth |
| generateEdgesboolean | If true, also generates an edge index buffer with the 12 box edges. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |

## createCylinder(radius, height, radialSegments, generateEdges)

Creates a cylinder geometry.

### Parameters

| radius*number | Cylinder radius |
| --- | --- |
| height*number | Cylinder height |
| radialSegmentsnumber | Number of circle segments |
| generateEdgesboolean | If true, also generates an edge index buffer with the top and bottom circle edges. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |

## createCone(radiusTop, radiusBottom, height, radialSegments, generateEdges)

Creates a cone frustum geometry (a cone with the tip cut off, leaving a flat top). A regular cone is the special case where radiusTop is 0.

### Parameters

| radiusTop*number | Radius of the top circle. 0 for a regular cone. |
| --- | --- |
| radiusBottom*number | Radius of the bottom circle. |
| height*number | Cone height |
| radialSegmentsnumber | Number of circle segments |
| generateEdgesboolean | If true, also generates an edge index buffer with the top and bottom circle edges. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |

## createPlane(width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments, generateEdges)

Creates a plane geometry lying in the XY plane.

### Parameters

| width*number | Plane width |
| --- | --- |
| height*number | Plane height |
| widthSegmentsnumber | Number of segments in X axis |
| heightSegmentsnumber | Number of segments in Y axis |
| generateEdgesboolean | If true, also generates an edge index buffer with the 4 outer edges. |

### Returns
