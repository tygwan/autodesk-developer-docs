# InstanceNode3D

Extends [Autodesk.Viewing.Scene.Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/Node3D)

Scene graph node that represents a single geometry instance.

## new InstanceNode3D(geometry, material)

Creates a new detached instance node based on the given geometry and material. The instance is created in the model when the node is added to an attached scene graph.

### Parameters

| geometry[BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |
| --- | --- |
| materialAutodesk.Viewing.Scene.Material |   |

# Properties

| instanceIdnumber, null | The instance ID in the instance collection, or `null` while detached. |
| --- | --- |
| parent[Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/Node3D/), null | Parent node in the scene graph, or `null` for the root. |
| childrenArray.<Node3D> | Direct child nodes. |
| position[Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | Local position relative to the parent. |
| quaternion[Quaternion](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Quaternion/) | Local rotation relative to the parent. |
| scale[Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | Local scale relative to the parent. |

# Methods

## getTransformWorld(target)

Reads the world transform matrix into the optional target matrix. When attached, reads from the instance collection (source of truth). When detached, copies from detached state.

### Parameters

| target[Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) | Matrix to write into. Recommended for allocation-free reads. |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) | The target filled with the world matrix, or a new matrix if no target is provided. |

## getVisibilityState()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [VisibilityState](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene#VisibilityState/) | The visibility state. |

## setVisibilityState(value)

Sets the visibility state for this node and its descendants.

### Parameters

| value*[VisibilityState](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene#VisibilityState/) |   |
| --- | --- |

## getMaterial()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| Autodesk.Viewing.Scene.Material | The material of the instance represented by this node. |

## setMaterial(material)

Sets material on the instance represented by this node.

### Parameters

| material*Autodesk.Viewing.Scene.Material |   |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | true, if the material was successfully set |

## getGeometry()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) | The geometry of the instance represented by this node. |

## setGeometry(geometry)

Sets the geometry of the instance represented by this node.

### Parameters

| geometry*[BufferGeometry](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/BufferGeometry/) |   |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | true, if the geometry was successfully set |

## updateTransformWorld(force)

Updates the world transform matrix for this node and writes it to the represented instance. Computations are performed immediately and propagated to all affected descendants.

### Parameters

| forceboolean | If true, forces update regardless of the dirty flag. |
| --- | --- |

## fromInstance(instanceId, modelOrParentNode)

Static method to create a new node from an existing instance in the instance collection.

### Parameters

| instanceId*number |   |
| --- | --- |
| modelOrParentNode*[Model](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/), [Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/Node3D/) | Parent node to which the new node is added. If a model is provided, the new node is added to the scene graph root. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [InstanceNode3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/InstanceNode3D/) | The new node. |

## getTransformLocal(target)

Computes the local transform matrix for this node.

### Parameters

| target[Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) | Matrix to write into. |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) | The target filled with the local matrix, or a new matrix if no target is provided. |

## markDirty()

Marks this node as needing a world matrix update. Call this after modifying `position`, `quaternion`, or `scale` when using dirty tracking.

## isAttached()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | True if the node is attached to a model’s instance collection, false otherwise. |

## remove(children)

Removes the given child nodes from this node and from the instance collection.

### Parameters

| children*[Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/Node3D/), Array.<Node3D> |   |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Node3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Scene/Node3D/) | A reference to this node. |
