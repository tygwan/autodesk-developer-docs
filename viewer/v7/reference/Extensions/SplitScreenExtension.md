# SplitScreenExtension

## new SplitScreenExtension(viewer, options)

This extension subdivides the LMV canvas into between 2 and 4 (inclusive) separate subcanvases.

The extension id is: `Autodesk.SplitScreen`

For each sub-canvas, you can specify a separate model filter function to control in which canvases each model shall appear. The canvases are numbered as follows: 0 1 2 3

By default (no modelFilter), all models are rendered to each subcanvas. Overlays are rendered into both canvases (unless selection highlighting proxies - which are associated with models)

Limitations: Most core features of LMV keep working (2D/3D render, mouse-over, selection, directional zoom etc.). However, there are currently some known limitations/tradeoffs:
- All canvases must use the same camera. Overcoming this requires to introduce a separate scene graph evaluation too.
- Subcanvas configuration is currently limited to subcanvases with the same aspect ratio. Extending that will (among others) require support for separate cameras.
- ZoomToolExtension, SectionTool, and Measure tool are disabled SplitScreen (we hide the UI)
- GroundShadow is supported, but doesn’t apply model filter yet when refreshing the shadow
- GroundReflection in SplitScreen is not supported yet.
- We currently use only a single background for both. This is hardly noticeable for discreet backgrounds like the AEC default or fixed colors, but may disturb when using more detailed environments.
