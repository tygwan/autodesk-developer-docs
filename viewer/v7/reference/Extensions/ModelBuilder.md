# ModelBuilder

**Deprecated: This class is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use Scene API instead.**

Class that implements the API for building models dynamically. An instance of this class can be obtained after the Promise returned by [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.SceneBuilder#addNewModel](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/SceneBuilder/#addNewModel/) is resolved.

## new ModelBuilder(model, options)

The constructor is invoked automatically by [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.SceneBuilder](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/SceneBuilder/).

### Parameters

| model*[Autodesk.Viewing.Model](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Model/) | The model this build works on |
| --- | --- |
| optionsobject | Options for the ModelBuilder |
| conserveMemoryboolean | Set to true to turn on memory conservation mode. In this mode [addMesh()]`Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.ModelBuilder#addMesh </en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/ModelBuilder/#addMesh/>`_ is not available because a single mesh is shared among all of the fragments in the model. |

# Methods

## isConservingMemory()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | true when the model being manipulated is using the memory-optimized code path. |

## addGeometry(geometry, numFragments)

Add geometry to the model.

### Parameters

| geometry*THREE.BufferGeometry | The geometry to add. This can be null or undefined to allocate a geometry id without geometry. |
| --- | --- |
| numFragmentsnumber | The number of fragments you expect this geometry to be used in. Default is 1. This is used to prioritize placing geometry on the GPU. Geometry used by more fragments gets a higher priority. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| number | The id of the added geometry, or 0 if there was an error. |

## changeGeometry(existingGeom, geometry, numFragments)

Change geometry in a model.

| --- | --- |
| geometry*THREE.BufferGeometry | Geometry that replaces the existing geometry |
| numFragmentsnumber | The number of fragments using this geometry. If not given, then we will count the number in the model. This is used to prioritize placing geometry on the GPU. Geometry used by more fragments gets a higher priority. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | True if the existing geometry is valid and the geometry was changed. |

## findGeometryFragments(geometry)

Find fragments using a specific geometry.

### Parameters

## addMesh(mesh)

Add a fragment to the model using a mesh. Meshes can only be added to the model when [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.ModelBuilder#isConservingMemory](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/ModelBuilder/#isConservingMemory/) is false. Note the following restrictions:
- A mesh cannot be used multiple times.
- The geometry for a mesh cannot be used in different models.
- The material for a mesh cannot be used in different models.

### Parameters

| mesh*THREE.Mesh | The mesh to be added. |
| --- | --- |
| isLineboolean | Optional bool to mark line geometry |
| isWideLineboolean | Optional bool to mark wide line geometry |
| isPointboolean | Optional bool to mark point geometry |
| fragIdnumber | The fragment id for the mesh. This must not be defined when addMesh() is called and the Viewer sets this property to the new fragment id. |
| modeIdnumber | The id of the model. This must not be defined when addMesh() is called and the Viewer will set this to the id of the model for this ModelBuilder. |
| dbIdnumber | An optional object id for the mesh. Meshes with the same object id are selected as a unit. Internal tables are maintained to link fragments and dbIds. If a mesh is in the scene you shouldn’t change this value direcly. Call [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.ModelBuilder#changeFragmentsDbId](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/ModelBuilder/#changeFragmentsDbId/) to change it to insure the tables are updated. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | True if the mesh was added. |

## removeMesh(meshes)

Remove a mesh from the model. Meshes can only be removed from the model when [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.ModelBuilder#isConservingMemory](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/ModelBuilder/#isConservingMemory/) is false.

### Parameters

| meshes*THREE.Mesh, Array.<THREE.Mesh> | The meshes to be removed. |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | True if the mesh was removed. |

## updateMesh(meshes, skipGeom, skipTransform)

Use this method to inform the Viewer when you directly update a mesh you added to the model. If you change a mesh directly without calling this method, it may not display properly. You don’t need to call this if you use the ModelBuilder API to update a mesh.

### Parameters

| --- | --- |
| skipGeomboolean | Set to true if the geometry in the meshes wasn’t updated |

| boolean | True if the viewer was updated |

## sceneUpdated(objectsMoved, skipRepaint)

Signal viewer that scene was modified.

### Parameters

| objectsMovedboolean | True if transforms or geometry was changed |
| --- | --- |
| skipRepaintboolean | True to skip repainting because of this change |

## addFragment(geometry, material, transform, bbox)

Add a fragment to a model. A fragment is the combination of a geometry, a material, and a transform.

### Parameters

| geometry*number, THREE.BufferGeometry | The geometry or the id of the geometry for the fragment. Use a falsey value if the geometry for the fragment isn’t ready. If the geometry hasn’t been added to the model, this method will add it. Geometry must not be used in a different model. |
| --- | --- |
| material*string, THREE.material | The material or the name of the material instance for the fragment. A material name must be used by a material in the model, but a material will be added to the model if it hasn’t already. |
| transform[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/), Array.<number> | The transform for the fragment. Default is the identity transform. If an array is used it is a 4x3 matrix in column major order. |
| bbox[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Box3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Box3/), Array.<number> | Bounding box for the fragment. Default is calculated from the geometry bounding box and the transform. When [Autodesk.Viewing.Extensions.ModelBuilder#isConservingMemory](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/ModelBuilder/#isConservingMemory/) is true then this argument is ignored and the default is used. If an array is used it contains the minimum x, y, z followed by the maximum x, y, z. |

### Returns
