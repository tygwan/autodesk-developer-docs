# Viewing

Viewing is the top-level namespace in the Viewer SDK library. Use these classes to implement basic viewer functionality.

There are many classes in the Viewing namespace. Depending on what you’re doing, you won’t need to use most of them. Here are a few essential methods and classes to get started using Viewer SDK.
- **Initializer**: Use this method to initialize the viewer environment and runtime. You’ll need to initialize the viewer before loading models into the viewer.
- **Viewer3D**: Use Viewer3D to connect to Autodesk Platform Services and display 2D and 3D models in a headless viewer object.
- **GUIViewer3D**: Use GUI Viewer3D instead of Viewer3D to create a viewer object with UI elements, including a toolbar.
- **ToolController**: Use ToolController if you plan to build your own tools in the viewer.

# Methods

## Initializer(options, callback)

Static method for initializing the viewer runtime. Models must be loaded after this step is completed.

Includes:
- End points of cloud services the viewer uses, like Model Derivative
- Authentication and authorization cookie settings on the client side
- Misc runtime environment variables and global viewer configurations parameters

### Parameters

| options*object | The options object contains configuration parameters used to do initializations. If no access token or authentication callback is provided, the Initializer will fall back on an access token provided in the URL query string, or a previous access token stored in the cookie cache, if available. |
| --- | --- |
| envstring | Either `AutodeskProduction`, `AutodeskStaging`, or `AutodeskDevelopment`. `Local` can be used to avoid attaching authentication headers to XHR requests. |
| apistring | If automatic routing (the `DS_ENDPOINTS` feature flag) is enabled, must be `streamingV2` for SVF2 or `derivativeV2` for SVF. If automatic routing is disabled, must be `streamingV2` (SVF2) or `derivativeV2` (SVF) for models stored in a US data center, `streamingV2_EU` (SVF2) or `derivativeV2_EU` (SVF) for models stored in a European data center, or `streamingV2_AUS` (SVF2) or `derivativeV2_AUS` (SVF) for models stored in an Australian data center. Defaults to `derivativeV2` if left undefined. |
| getAccessTokenfunction | An function that provides an access token asynchronously. The function signature is `getAccessToken(onSuccess)`, where onSuccess is a callback that getAccessToken function should invoke when a token is granted, with the token being the first input parameter for the onSuccess function, and the token expire time (in seconds) being the second input parameter for the function. Viewer relies on both getAccessToken and the expire time to automatically renew token, so it is critical that getAccessToken must be implemented as described here. |
| accessTokenstring | An access token. Not needed when `options.getAccessToken` is provided.` |
| webGLHelpLinkstring | A link to a help page on webGL if it’s disabled. |
| languagestring | Preferred language code as defined in RFC 4646, such as `en`, `de`, `fr`, etc. If no language is set, viewer will pick it up from the browser. If language is not as defined in RFC, viewer will fall back to “en” (English) but the behavior is undefined. |
| lmvResourceRootstring | The root folder that contains LMV resources, will be derived if not specified. |
| callback*function | A method the client executes when initialization is finished. |

### Examples

```
 var options = {
   env: "AutodeskProduction",
   language: "en",
   getAccessToken: function(onSuccess) {
       // TODO: Get actual APS token and expiration time.
       var accessToken = 'your_access_token';
       var expirationTimeSeconds = 5 * 60; // 5 minutes
       onSuccess(accessToken, expirationTimeSeconds);
   }
};
var myCallback = function() {
   console.log("initialization complete, creating the viewer...");
};
Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer(options, myCallback);
```

## shutdown()

Counterpart to Autodesk.Viewing.Initializer, use it to free up memory. Developers need to uninitialize all [Autodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/) instances before invoking this function.
