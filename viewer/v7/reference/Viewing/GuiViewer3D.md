## start(url, options, onSuccessCallback, onErrorCallback, initOptions)

Initializes the viewer and loads any extensions specified in the constructor’s config parameter. If the optional parameters are specified, the start() function will use an optimized initialization sequence that results in faster model load. The parameters are the same as the ones for Viewer3D.loadModel and you do not need to call loadModel subsequently if the model is loaded via the call to start().

| --- | --- |
| optionsobject | Optional path to shared property database. |
| onSuccessCallbackAutodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D~onLoadModelSuccess | Method that gets called when initial loading is done and streaming starts. |

| initOptionsobject | Optional: Options forwarded to viewer.initialize() |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| number | 0 if the viewer has started, an error code (same as that returned by initialize()) otherwise. |

## setUp(config)

Loading extensions and initializing canvas interactions. Invoked automatically by [Autodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D#start](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#start/) method.

### Parameters

| configobject | configuration values |
| --- | --- |
| extensionsArray.<string> | List of extension ids to load with the model. |
| canvasConfigobject | Overrides for click/tap events on the 3D canvas. Refer to #setCanvasClickBehavior for details. |

## tearDown(isUnloadModelsWanted)

Unloads extensions and the loaded models. Invoked automatically by [Autodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D#finish](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#finish/) method.

### Parameters

| isUnloadModelsWantedboolean | Whether to unload models at the end. Default is true. |
| --- | --- |

## _onAggregatedSelectionChanged()

When selection has changed set the pivot point to be in the middle, if Autodesk.Viewing.Private.Prefs3D.SELECTION_SETS_PIVOT is true

## run()

Triggers the Viewer’s render loop. Invoked automatically by [Autodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D#start](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/#start/) method. Refer to ViewerConfig.startOnInitialize to change start’s method behavior.

## localize()

Localize the viewer. This method can be overwritten so that the subclasses can localize any additional elements. Invoked internally during initialization and automatically after resource reload on language change.

## uninitialize()

Removes all created DOM elements, performs GL uninitialization that is needed and removes event listeners.

## finish()

Unloads any loaded extensions and then uninitializes the viewer.

## loadModel(url, options, onSuccessCallback, onErrorCallback)

Loads a model into the viewer. Can be used sequentially to load multiple 3D models into the same scene.

### Parameters

| url*string | The url to the model. |
| --- | --- |
| optionsobject | Dictionary of options. |
| fileLoader[Autodesk.Viewing.FileLoader](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/FileLoader/) | The file loader to use for this url. Required for unsupported file types. |
| keepCurrentModelsboolean | Flag indicating whether viewer should keep or unload all other models. |
| loadOptionsobject | May contain params that are specific for certain loaders/filetypes. |
| sharedPropertyDbPathstring | Optional path to shared property database. |
| idsstring | A list of object IDs to load. |
| loadAsHiddenboolean | By default, a new model is instantly shown and triggers viewer refreshes during loading. Setting this option avoids that. The model can then be shown later by calling showModel(). |
| modelNameOverridestring | Allows host application to override model name used in UI. |
| placementTransform[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Matrix4](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Matrix4/) | Applied to the model during loading. |

If only ‘to’ is set, you can just assign a string directly, e.g. applyScaling = ‘m’ is the same as applyScaling = { to: ‘m’ }. |
| applyPlacementInModelUnitsboolean | Only relevant if options.placementTransform and options.applyScaling are both used at once. In this way, it controls the order in which placement and scaling happen: - False: Placement happens in viewer world-units. That is, applyScaling is done first, then the custom placementMatrix is applied. (Default behavior) - True: Placement happens in model units. That is, custom placementMatrix is applied first, then the unit scaling. |
| onSuccessCallbackAutodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D~onLoadModelSuccess | A method that gets called when model’s metadata loading is done and geometry streaming starts. |
| onErrorCallbackAutodesk.Viewing.Viewer3D~onLoadModelFailure | A method that gets called when loading fails. |

## isLoadDone(include)

A model is completely loaded when the root model is loaded, all of the geometry is loaded, the property database, if present is loaded and no textures are being loaded.

### Parameters

| includeObject | Optional object to set the scope of the wait |
| --- | --- |
| geometryBoolean | Set to false to exclude the geometry loading from consideration. Because textures are loaded with geometry, include.textures must also be set to false to prevent geometry from being considered. Defaults to true. |

| --- | --- |
| Boolean | True if all models are completely loaded, otherwise false |

## waitForLoadDone(include)

Wait for models to be completely loaded This method checks all models in the model queue and load requests that haven’t loaded the root model yet. A model is completely loaded when the root model is loaded, all of the geometry is loaded, the property database, if there is one, is loaded and no textures are being loaded. If this method is called before the viewer is started, then it will wait until the viewer starts and at least one model start loading to check for the load completing

### Parameters
