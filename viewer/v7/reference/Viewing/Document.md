# Document

## new Document(dataJSON, path, acmsession, acmscope)

Allows the client to load the model data from the cloud, it gives access to the root and provides a method for finding elements by id.

Typically, you load the document from APS, parse it for the required content (for example, 3d geometries), then pass this on to the viewer to display. You can also get some information about the document, such as the number of views it contains and its thumbnail image.

### Parameters

| dataJSON*object | JSON data representing the document. |
| --- | --- |
| path*string | Path/URL where dataJSON was fetched from. |
| acmsessionstring | ACM session ID. |
| acmscopestring | ACM scope ID. |

| onErrorCallback*Autodesk.Viewing.Document~loadErrorCallback | A function that is called when load fails. |
