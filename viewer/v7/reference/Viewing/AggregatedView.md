# AggregatedView

AggregatedView implements a viewing application based on Viewer3D. Its purpose is to provide functionality around Viewer3D to facilitate implementation of viewer application workflows like switching between different views or toggling models on/off dynamically.

Examples of AggregatedView functionality include:
- **Facilitate use in react**: Just set an array of nodes from React property and AggregatedView takes care to make sure that models are loaded and shown/hidden as needed.
- **LRU-Caching of models**: Keep models in memory for fast switches, but unload unused models if memory is critical
- **Extensions**: Setting up a couple of useful default extensions (can be customized or switched off where wanted)
- **Home camera**: Setting a home view camera that considers multiple models.
- **Application State management**: Facilitates some state management, e.g.  Setting a camera without having to care whether the model is already loaded or not.
- Starting Walk-mode without having to care whether BIMWalk extension is already loaded.
- Allow toggling visibility of a model without having to care about the loading state of the model.
- **GlobalOffsets**: Choose globalOffset automatically, but identically for all models to make sure that they are placed consistently.
- **View Switches**: Allow visibility toggling (`hide`/`show`) versus full view switches (`switchView(nodes)`), the latter including proper reset of camera, UI, and extensions
- **Diff Setups**: Just set diffOptions to setup change visualization of aggregated views.

## new AggregatedView()

### Examples

```
const view = new Autodesk.Viewing.AggregatedView();
// Initialize the aggregatedView with the HTML element and the options object
await view.init(viewerElement, options);
```

# Methods

## init(parentDiv, options)

Initializes the AggregatedView and loads the following predefined extensions: `Autodesk.CrossFadeEffects`, `Autodesk.AEC.LevelsExtension`, `Autodesk.ModelStructure`, `Autodesk.AEC.HyperlinkExtension`, `Autodesk.AEC.Minimap3DExtension`, `Autodesk.AEC.CanvasBookmarkExtension` and `Autodesk.AEC.DropMeExtension` The initialization can also be customized with the options object.

To initialize the viewer without loading the specified extension please reference [initViewerInstance](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/AggregatedView/#initViewerInstance/).

### Parameters

| parentDiv*HTMLDivElement | The div element in which the viewer will be initialized |
| --- | --- |
| optionsObject | Configuration options for aggregated view |
| viewerConfigObject | Used for initializing GuiViewer3D. This is the options object that is passed into either av.Viewer3D or av.GuiViewer3D |
| disableBookmarksboolean | Disable display of visual bookmarks |
| clusterfckObject | Dependency-Injection of clusterfck library (enables clustering of Bookmark icons) |
| viewerStartOptionsObject | Options passed to the viewer initialization process |
| ignoreGlobalOffsetboolean | Forces globalOffset to undefined for all loaded models. Effect of this is that all models are auto-centered using the model bbox. Note that this does only work if you never show more than one 3D viewable at once |
| unloadUnfinishedModelsboolean | By setting unloadUnfinishedModels, when calling hide(bubbleNode), it will unload models that haven’t been fully loaded. Used in order to reduce amount of file loaders when switching between models |
| useDynamicGlobalOffsetboolean | If true, the globalOffset is applied dynamically after loading |
| cameraValidatorboolean | Called with a (camera, model) when using a model camera as start or home camera. This allows for clients to apply optional custom repairs for models with messy camera data |
| propagateInputEventTypesArray.<string> | By default, LMV ToolController “eats” all handled events so that they don’t reach any other widgets. Specify an array of event types that you want this behaviour disabled for. For example [‘mouseup’, ‘mousedown’] allows alloy to detect mouse outside clicks to close pending dropdown menus |
| createModelAlignmentService*function | Factory function to create AlignmentService implementation for loading/saving model transforms. See AlignmentServices above for details |
| getCustomLoadOptionsfunction | Allows for applying custom options to be used for all model loading. The callback returns an options object that is applied by default in all model-load calls. The signature should look like: function(av.BubbleNode)=>Object |
| viewerUnitsstring | If specified, all models are re-scaled from model units to this unit. Must be a GNU unit format string, e.g. “m”. |
| forceWorldUpDirectionArray.<number> | If specified, the world up direction is forced to the given vector. Models with different world up directions in the manifest are rotated to align with the given vector. Must be an array of three numbers, e.g. [0, 1, 0]. |
| multiViewerFactoryAutodesk.Viewing.MultiViewerFactory | Optional multi viewer factory. Used to create multiple viewers with shared resources |
| useConsolidationboolean | Optional flag to enable / disable mesh consolidation. Defaults to true. |

Load/Unload models so that the currently loaded models matches with the given list of svfs.

Note: Use [switchView()](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/AggregatedView/#switchView/) to do an explicit view switch (including resetting tools/camera). Use setModels() to reconfiguring which models are visible in the current view.

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |

## findDiffSupportModel(sheetNode)

“Support models” are 3D models that augment 2D diffs for better results: Instead of comparing the 2D objects directly, the correspodning 3D counterparts are compared. This is more reliable and avoids false positives due to irrelevant plotting differences. We use master views as support models, because they contain all objects of a given phase.

Given a bubble node referring to a 2D sheet node, this function returns the bubbleNode of the corresponding 3D master view that belongs to the same phase. This can be used as “support model” to obtain better results for 2D diff.

### Parameters

| sheetNode*[Autodesk.Viewing.BubbleNode](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/BubbleNode/) | A 2d bubble node |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Viewing.BubbleNode](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/BubbleNode/) | the coresponding 3d bubble node |

## findDiffSupportModels(diffConfig)

Find corresponding 3D model for each diff/primary The result will be stored in the passed in diffConfig. The results will be in diffConfig.supportBubbles.diff and diffConfig.supportBubbles.primary.

For the diffConfig parameter reference [setNodes](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/AggregatedView/#setNodes/).

### Parameters

| diffConfig*Object | see the setNodes method for the diffConfig parameter |
