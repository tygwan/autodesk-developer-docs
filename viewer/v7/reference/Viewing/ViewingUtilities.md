# ViewingUtilities

## new ViewingUtilities(viewerImplIn, autocam, navapi)

Variety of utilities convenient to navigation and tool development.

This class is instantiated internally and made available to all registered interaction tools via their “utilities” property.

### Parameters

| viewerImplIn*object | The viewer implementation object. |
| --- | --- |
| autocam*object | The Autocam interface object. |
| navapi*object | The Navigation interface object. |

# Methods

## transitionView(pos, coi, fov, up, worldUp, reorient, pivot)

This method triggers a camera view transition as specified by the parameters.

### Parameters

| pos*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new world space position of the camera. |
| --- | --- |
| coi*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new center of interest (look at point). |
| fov*number | The new field of view for the camera in degrees. |
| up*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new camera up direction. |
| worldUp*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new world up direction. |
| reorient*boolean | If true the given camera up parameter is ignored and a new up direction will be calculated to be aligned with the given world up direction. |
| pivot*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new pivot point. |

## goHome()

This method triggers a camera view transition to the registered home view for the current scene.

## getHitPoint(x, y)

This method performs a hit test with the current model using a ray cast from the given screen coordinates.

### Parameters

| x*number | The normalized screen x coordinate in [0, 1]. |
| --- | --- |
| y*number | The normalized screen y coordinate in [0, 1]. |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The world space hit position or null if no object was hit. |

## activatePivot(fadeIt)

This method activates the in scene pivot indicator. The pivot is positioned at the current camera’s pivot point.

### Parameters

| fadeIt*boolean | If true the indicator will be displayed and then fade away after a short period. |
| --- | --- |

## pivotActive(state, fadeIt)

This method changes the display state of the in scene pivot indicator. If the current scene is 2D this method has no effect.

### Parameters

| state*boolean | The requested display state for the indicator. |
| --- | --- |
| fadeIt*boolean | If true and “state” is also true, the indicator will be displayed and then fade away after a short period. |

## pivotUpdate()

Invoke this method to refresh the pivot indicator and continue its fading action if required.

## setPivotPoint(newPivot, preserveView, isset)

Set the current pivot point and pivot set flag. If the pivot indicator is active its position will be updated accordingly. If a temporary pivot was previously applied, its saved state will be cleared.

### Parameters

| newPivot*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The world space position of the new pivot point. |
| --- | --- |
| preserveView*boolean | If false the camera’s view direction will change to look at the new pivot point. If true the camera’s view will not be changed. |
| isset*boolean | The new state of the pivot set flag. |

## savePivot(name)

Save a copy of the current pivot point and pivot set flag.

### Parameters

| name*string | Optional unique name of the saved location. |
| --- | --- |

## restorePivot(name)

Restore the saved copy of the current pivot point and pivot set flag. Once restored the saved value is erased.

### Parameters

| name*string | Optional unique name of the saved location. |
| --- | --- |

## setTemporaryPivot(newPivot)

Allows the caller to save the current pivot and replace it with a new location. If while the temporary pivot is active a new pivot is set via the setPivotPoint method, the saved pivot will be cleared to avoid restoring an out of date pivot location.

### Parameters

| newPivot*[Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Vector3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Vector3/) | The new pivot to be assigned or null to clear any previously saved pivot. |
| --- | --- |

## removeTemporaryPivot()

Restore a pivot value that was saved by a call to setTemporary Pivot.

## setPivotSize(scale)

Changes the pivot graphic size.

### Parameters

| scale*number | Default size value is 1 |
| --- | --- |

## setPivotColor(color, opacity)

Change pivot color and opacity. Example, to get red 100% solid (non-transparent) use setPivotColor(0xFF0000, 1)

### Parameters

| color*number | RBG Hex color. |
| --- | --- |
| opacitynumber | Opacity value from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque). |

## getBoundingBox(ignoreSelection)

Return the bounding box of the current model or model selection.

### Parameters

| ignoreSelection*boolean | If true the current selection is ignored and the model bounds is returned. |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Viewing.Math.Box3](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Math/Box3/) |   |

## fitToView(immediate)

Request a camera transition to fit the current model or model selection into the view frustum.

### Parameters

| immediate*boolean | If true the transition will be immediate, otherwise animated over a short time period. |
