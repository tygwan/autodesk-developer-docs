# ExtensionManager

The ExtensionManager manages all the extensions available to the viewer. Register, retrieve, and unregister your extension using the singleton `Autodesk.Viewing.theExtensionManager`.

You can load/unload your registered extension into a Viewer by invoking viewer.loadExtension(id, options) and viewer.unloadExtension(id), respectively.
