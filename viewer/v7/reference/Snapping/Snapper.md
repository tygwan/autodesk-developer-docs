# Snapper

## new Snapper(viewer, options)

A tool that lets users attach pointer events to vertices and edges. It supports 2D and 3D models.

### Parameters

| viewer*[Viewer3D](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/Viewer3D/) | Viewer instance |
| --- | --- |
| options*object | Configurations for the extension |

# Methods

## isActive()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | true when the tool is active |

## activate()

Starts intercepting pointer events. Invoked automatically by the [ToolController](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/ToolController/).

## deactivate()

Stops intercepting pointer events. Invoked automatically by the [ToolController](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/ToolController/).

## getSnapResult()

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| [SnapResult](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/MeasureCommon/SnapResult/) | The snapping status of the last pointer event performed. |

## isSnapped()

Checks whether the tool’s last update resulted on a snap.

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | true when the last pointer event got snapped. |

## snapping3D(result)

3D Snapping

### Parameters

| result* | Result of Hit Test. |
| --- | --- |

## extractLineGeometry(edge, geometry)

Get Edge geometry for the case that the hittest result contained a 3D lines. For this case, we have no Face3, so that faceSnapping and edgeSnapping don’t work.

### Parameters

| edge*Object | {a, b} with vertex indices a,b of lineStart/lineEnd vertex |
| --- | --- |
| geometry*GeometryBuffer |   |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| THREE.Geometry, THREE.BufferGeometry | Geometry with simple line |

## faceIsCurved(face)

Checks if the given geometry is curved

### Parameters

| face*THREE.BufferGeometry | The geometry |
| --- | --- |

### Returns

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | True if the any of the faces composing the geometry is curved |

## snapping2D(hitResult, options)

Snap to a 2D model.

### Parameters

| hitResult*object | a result of a ray intersection. |
| --- | --- |
| optionsobject | Options object. |
| enumSegmentsfunction | Enumerates all segments within a given bbox in model-space. |
